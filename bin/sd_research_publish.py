"""Register a research repo with the dashboard, and queue its outward mirrors.

The publication contract is
`skills/_shared/references/publication-contract.md`; this is the half of it a
script can carry out. Two jobs, both run at the end of `render`:

1. **Register.** Write a `root|key|label|directory` line to the dashboard's
   `documents.conf` for a directory the dashboard cannot find on disk. The
   file is in the machine's config directory, not the dashboard checkout;
   `dashboard_config` says where. The dashboard finds `docs/dashboard/` by
   itself and takes its name from the workflow database, so that default
   location gets no line. The dashboard reads that file and never writes it,
   so nothing here touches the dashboard's own source.

2. **Enqueue.** For each document designated for a destination in
   `DESTINATIONS`, write a sync request naming the document, its container, the
   page or file to update and the source revision. Rendering runs in a git hook
   and in CI, neither of which can reach an MCP server, and the pack holds no
   credential for any destination -- so a render never calls one and does not
   try. An agent session drains the queue.

One queue for every destination rather than one queue each, and one request
file per document *per destination*: a document designated for two places is
two independent pieces of outstanding work, and either can drain while the
other waits. The filename carries the repo, the document and the destination,
so a re-render overwrites the pending request rather than queueing a second --
and a re-render of an unchanged document writes nothing at all, pending or
drained, because a receipt beside the queue remembers what was last queued.

A request that is never drained stays on disk: the queue does not expire,
because an expiring queue reports a mirror as done that was never written.

    An explicit `space=` overrides the folder but never the scope: naming a
    folder says where inside a space, not which space.

    The container is carried as `space_id`, a Notion page id, and `resolve`

    `space=` written as an id or a page URL; a rename cannot touch those.
    `name` is a `space=` written as a plain name, which no id can be derived
    from -- there the drain does look the folder up by name, and the contract
    makes an empty lookup a failure to report rather than a folder to create.

    A default also carries `subfolder`, the repo's own page under that folder,
    the way a Drive default carries `Briefs/<repo>`. The repo's `channels`
    setting may name that page instead (`folder`, sd:3462). An explicit
    `space=` carries none: naming a container says where the document goes,

    Migration rather than reading both for ever. Two directories mean every
    reader has to know both names, and a reader written later knows one -- the
    defect being closed here is exactly that. Moving once leaves one queue,
    and this function then finds nothing and says nothing on every later run.

    Nothing is created by looking. A machine that never used the old name has
    no legacy directory, and this neither makes one nor makes `QUEUE` to
    receive an empty migration.

    The emptied directory is left standing. Removing it would buy tidiness at
    the price of a new deletion path, and `tests/test_archive_untouched.py`
    enumerates and freezes every one under `bin/` precisely so that no new
    sweep appears for a reason that small. An empty directory strands nothing:
    the requests were what was stranded, and they have moved.

    The current queue wins a name collision. Both directories hold one request
    per document per destination under the same filename, and the rename is
    what stopped the old name being written -- so a file in `QUEUE` was
    written after its legacy twin, and keeping the older one would replace a
    current request with a stale revision.

    The requests move verbatim. An old request may predate a field a reader
    now expects; `bin/sd-status` already falls back for the one it reads, and
    rewriting somebody's queued work to a schema it was not written under is a

#: The git triggers the re-render hook installs under. A commit is not the only
#: way a document changes: a pull rewrites the working tree, a branch switch
#: replaces it outright, and `git checkout <rev> -- doc.md` rewrites one
#: document in place without moving HEAD at all. A `docs/dashboard/` left from
#: the old tree is the stale render this hook exists to prevent. One source under three
#: names, because three copies of one script drift; the script reads its own
#: `argv[0]` to know which trigger fired and how to ask git what moved.
HOOK_TRIGGERS = ("post-commit", "post-merge", "post-checkout")

#: The hook that keeps `docs/dashboard/` current, as text rather than a file beside
#: the skill. Two rules put it here, both pinned by
#: `tests/test_no_shipped_shell.py`: `skills/` is the render surface and is
#: markdown only, because a file there is payload copied onto a platform home;
#: and the pack ships no shell outside `.github/scripts/`. So the hook is
#: Python, stdlib only, and it lives in the module that installs it. It carries
#: `#` comments rather than docstrings because it is itself a string literal
#: here, and a `"""` inside one would end it.
HOOK = '''#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Re-render this research repo when git changes a document.
#
# Installed by `sd-research-kit init-hook` under three names at once:
# post-commit, post-merge and post-checkout. A pull, a branch switch and a
# checkout of one path change the documents as surely as a commit does, and
# a `docs/dashboard/` left from the old tree is the stale render this exists
# to prevent. Post-commit and not pre-commit: `docs/dashboard/` is generated
# and not committed, so there is nothing to stage, and the commit is the
# revision a queued mirror should name.
#
# One source, three names, and the trigger is read from `argv[0]`, because each
# one has to ask git a different question. `diff-tree ... HEAD` is
# commit-shaped: it prints nothing at all for a merge commit, and a checkout's
# HEAD says nothing about what the checkout moved. So a copy of the
# post-commit body under the other two names would never render.
#
# Rendered output goes stale the moment its source changes, and a stale page is
# worse than a missing one because it looks current. This is what keeps the
# dashboard's Documents tab a statement about the render rather than about who
# remembered to run it.
#
# Never fails the git command. The commit, the merge or the checkout is already
# made when this runs, so exiting non-zero would report a failure for work that
# succeeded. A render that cannot run says so and leaves git alone.
#
# `SD_SKIP_RENDER=1` skips it, for all three.
#
# A render executes research.conf.py, and after a pull or a checkout it can
# be one nobody here has read. A commit does not vouch for it either: after a
# declined pull, a commit of doc.md alone leaves the incoming config in the
# tree. So all three render only a config a render by hand has executed here,
# and otherwise say how to render once it is read. The render they run is told
# it is automatic, checks the bytes it executes again, and records nothing
# (sd:1376). Whether a repository may instruct this tool at all is sd:1375.
#
# A branch checkout that lands behind its upstream renders and queues no
# mirror (sd:1991). Checking out a stale `main` and pulling it is the usual
# way to update, and the checkout's render queued the stale text for the
# shared mirror a moment before the pull's render replaced it: a drain in
# between published it. The render is told why in `SD_SKIP_MIRROR`. Only
# the local tracking ref is read, so nothing here fetches, and a branch with
# no upstream renders and queues as before.

#: Every earlier body this module released, byte for byte, so that an
#: installation made by one of them can be recognised and replaced rather than
#: refused. Without this the fix above reaches nobody: every repository that
#: has the hook has one of these, `init-hook` would read it as somebody else's
#: file, and the only installations that could ever get three triggers are the
#: ones that do not exist yet.
#:
#: Exact bodies and not a "looks like ours" test, because the whole value of
#: refusing a foreign file is that the refusal cannot be talked out of. A
#: single byte that this pack did not write is still foreign and still refused.
#:
#: The list is the whole population, read out of this file's own history --
#: `git rev-list --all --full-history -- bin/sd_research_publish.py`, every
#: blob parsed for its `HOOK` assignment. Two bodies were released: the one
#: `05d4b9d3` shipped, and the one `fa5f5576` replaced it with and `47d4d147`
#: still carried. They differ in one comment word.
#:
#: The other two are this branch's own. A branch owns the predecessors it
#: creates: each of its commits is a revision somebody can check out and run
#: `init-hook` from, and each is history the moment the branch lands, so a
#: body left off here is an installation this verb refuses for the rest of its
#: life. "Released as of today" is the wrong reading and does not survive its
#: own criterion -- it is the reading that left `4d20574b`'s body off, and the
#: review that caught it ran the installer against the body of the very
#: revision it was reviewing. A body from a branch that has not landed belongs
#: to that branch, which adds it when it does -- and the fifth body below is
#: sd:1352's, added by the merge that brought that branch in. The rule is the
#: same one read from the other side: a merge inherits the predecessors of
#: what it merges, because those revisions are checkouts here too. The sixth
#: is this branch's merge commit's own body, superseded by the commit that
#: gave the hook `docs/dashboard/` and an explicit all-zeros guard.
#:
#: Measured rather than assumed, because "released" is the tempting reading
#: and it is not this one: `4d20574b` and `dd14d501` are in here and neither
#: ever reached `main`. What puts a body on a machine is a checkout, and an
#: ancestor commit is a checkout.
#:
#: Downward only in one direction: a body leaves this tuple when no machine can
#: still be carrying it, which is not a thing this repository can know. Assume
#: it never happens, and add to it whenever `HOOK` changes.

# Re-render this research repo when git changes a document.
#
# Installed by `sd-research-kit init-hook` under three names at once:
# post-commit, post-merge and post-checkout. A pull, a branch switch and a
# checkout of one path change the documents as surely as a commit does, and
# a `docs/dashboard/` left from the old tree is the stale render this exists
# to prevent. Post-commit and not pre-commit: `docs/dashboard/` is generated
# and not committed, so there is nothing to stage, and the commit is the
# revision a queued mirror should name.
#
# One source, three names, and the trigger is read from `argv[0]`, because each
# one has to ask git a different question. `diff-tree ... HEAD` is
# commit-shaped: it prints nothing at all for a merge commit, and a checkout's
# HEAD says nothing about what the checkout moved. So a copy of the
# post-commit body under the other two names would never render.
#
# Rendered output goes stale the moment its source changes, and a stale page is
# worse than a missing one because it looks current. This is what keeps the
# dashboard's Documents tab a statement about the render rather than about who
# remembered to run it.
#
# Never fails the git command. The commit, the merge or the checkout is already
# made when this runs, so exiting non-zero would report a failure for work that
# succeeded. A render that cannot run says so and leaves git alone.
#
# `SD_SKIP_RENDER=1` skips it, for all three.
#
# A render executes research.conf.py, and after a pull or a checkout it can
# be one nobody here has read. A commit does not vouch for it either: after a
# declined pull, a commit of doc.md alone leaves the incoming config in the
# tree. So all three render only a config a render by hand has executed here,
# and otherwise say how to render once it is read. The render they run is told
# it is automatic, checks the bytes it executes again, and records nothing
# (sd:1376). Whether a repository may instruct this tool at all is sd:1375.
#
# A branch checkout that lands behind its upstream renders and queues no
# mirror (sd:1991). Checking out a stale `main` and pulling it is the usual
# way to update, and the checkout's render queued the stale text for the
# shared mirror a moment before the pull's render replaced it: a drain in
# between published it. The render is told why in `SD_SKIP_MIRROR`. Only
# the local tracking ref is read, so nothing here fetches, and a branch with
# no upstream renders and queues as before.
