"""`sd fleet stamp`: lay the auto-merge fleet's shared files, one repository at a time.

Every repository whose `repo.runner_merge` row says `auto` is merged by the
runner through `sd-ship`, and `sd-ship merge` under a declared gap needs four
things the repository itself carries (sd:1326, decision D5 on sd:1334):

  * the review-route workflow at the pack's current pin, and its Dependabot
    guard -- the same text `sd-review setup-github` writes, from
    `bin/sd_setup_github.py`, not a second copy;
  * a check workflow, because `every_check` refuses a head nothing validated
    and a repository with no `pull_request` workflow has nothing to run;
  * the `unprotected` entry in `.github/sd-status.json`, in the plain
    "no protection by decision" form, only where GitHub positively reports
    the default branch unprotected (see `branch_protection`);
  * the `CLAUDE.local.md` block, rendered by `bin/sd_install.py`, and
    `docs/dashboard/` ignored and present for generated HTML;
  * the Claude Code settings baseline, `SECRET_READ_DENY` (sd:1661), per
    repository class: an owned or co-owned repository carries it in a
    tracked `.claude/settings.json`, and a guest one, which takes no tracked
    file of ours, in the untracked `.claude/settings.local.json`.

The verb is idempotent: it renders what each file should hold and diffs that
against what the file holds, so a second run over a stamped repository finds
nothing, and the same run after a pin moves is the pin bump. `--dry-run`
prints the diff per repository and writes nothing anywhere.

A dry run walks the auto rows read-only. Tracked files are read at each
checkout's `origin/HEAD` -- the branch a stamp pull request would target, not
whatever the operator has checked out -- and the untracked two
(`CLAUDE.local.md`, the `docs/dashboard/` directory) from the checkout itself.
Nothing here fetches: a stale `origin/HEAD` gives a stale diff, and the header
names the commit it read so the reader can tell.

A write takes no path (R10-D6): it stamps the checkout the caller stands in,
which must be a checkout of an auto repository. Tracked files are written only
on a feature branch; on the default branch the write lays the untracked files
and says the rest needs a worktree.

Employer repositories -- any owner not in `configured_owners` -- are adapted, never
changed in their settings: they keep their protection, so they get no
`unprotected` declaration, and the dry run says so rather than going quiet.

A repository whose `repo.ci` row says `local` gets no workflow at all
(sd:1843): neither the route workflow and its guard nor the check workflow.
`sd-ship merge` runs `sd-check` at the head and posts `sd/local-gate` in their
place, and the plan says so as an adapted line rather than going quiet.
A route workflow still tracked there is named with `sd-review setup-github
--remove`; the stamp lays files and deletes none.

A repository declines a stamped file once, in a tracked `.github/sd-fleet.json`
holding `{"exempt": [<path>, ...]}` (sd:1797). The stamp proposes no exempt
path and says so as an adapted line, so a declined file is not proposed on
every run. A path must be one the stamp writes, and a file that does not read
refuses the repository rather than guessing which files were declined. The
fleet audit is `--dry-run`, so it honours the same list.

An owned repository gets the declaration only where GitHub says, live, that
its default branch has no protection (sd:1655). Before, every owned auto repo
was assumed unprotected, and the dry run proposed the declaration in
repositories whose `main` a ruleset or classic protection guards -- some of
which had deleted the file on purpose. Protection is read both ways GitHub
offers it, through `sd_protection`, the reader `sd-ship` and `sd-status`
share, and the answer takes one of the three states `sd_db.protection` files
per repository: `protected`, `unprotected`, `unknown`. Only `unprotected`
lays the entry; `unknown` never does, and the summary names it.
