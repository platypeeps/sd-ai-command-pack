"""Review routing: which providers see a change, and why.

One pure function. ``route`` takes the paths a change touches, how many lines it
moves, whether the pull request is a draft, and a policy dictionary the caller
loaded from JSON. It returns a :class:`Plan`. It reads no files, runs no
subprocesses, and asks no network -- everything it decides is a function of its
arguments, so a fixture is a dict and a plan is comparable with ``==``.

The policy is data on purpose. Which categories exist, which paths are sensitive,
which tier each category starts at, and which providers each tier chains are all
per-repository choices; the rules for combining them are not.

Policy shape (every key optional unless noted)::

    {
      "tier_order": ["skip", "cheap", "standard", "deep"],
      "tiers": {"skip": [], "cheap": ["codex"], "deep": ["codex", "prism"]},

      "categories": [
        {"name": "tooling", "required": true, "paths": ["bin/**"],
         "tier": "deep"}
      ],

    """Decide which review tier a change gets, and which providers run in it.

    The order below is the whole contract, and each step can only be reached
    when the one before it did not settle the question:

    1. Categories match required-first, so a repository can guarantee that
       "touches the installer" outranks "is mostly documentation" no matter
       which order the two appear in the file. The matched category names the
       starting tier; without a match the policy default starts it. A category
       that lowers the tier below that default needs *every* path to be in it;
       one that holds or raises the tier needs only one. See
       ``_match_category`` -- "is mostly documentation" has to mean mostly.
    2. A change whose every path is in the ``docs_skip`` allow-list plans
       ``skip`` -- unless any path is in the ``never_skip`` deny-list, which
       always wins. That deny-list is why the allow-list is safe to widen: a
       repository can say "documentation is free" and still keep one directory
       inside it reviewed.
    3. A sensitive path or a change past the line threshold escalates one tier
       each, up to the top of the chain.
    4. A draft asks for the cheapest tier that still reviews something: drafts
       are re-reviewed when they open, so paying the deep chain twice buys
       nothing. A plan that already reached ``skip`` stays there, being cheaper.

    One rule, applied by which way the category's tier points relative to the

        One touched installer file makes the whole change an installer change,

      * A category that **lowers** the tier matches only when **every** path is

        same reason.

    The asymmetry is not a special case for documentation, it is the safe
    direction in each case. Matching a lowering category on any path meant one
    markdown file could drop a source change from `standard` to `cheap` and
    take a reviewer off it; because every work item lives under `docs/work/`,
    that silently under-reviewed nearly every change made through this
