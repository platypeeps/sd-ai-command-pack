"""Machine-wide gate slots: at most N repository gates run at once (sd:1541, sd:1996).

On 2026-09-25 several gates started together, the load average reached 157,
and tests with a fixed bound failed. On 2026-09-28 nine `sd-ship` gates across
repositories reached 141 on 16 cores, and a vitest default of 5 s failed tests
that assert nothing about time. Every local gate now waits for a slot first.

A slot is a kernel `flock` on `<dir>/slot.N.lock`. The kernel drops it when the
last descriptor on that open file closes, so a holder that dies frees its slot,
and no waiter ever judges a holder dead or deletes anything. The pid written
into a lock file is a hint for a reader, never evidence (#1195 review).

One implementation, two callers. `sd-check` takes a slot around the checks it
runs; `.github/scripts/run-tests.sh` opens the lock files itself and runs the
`wait` command below on those descriptors, so the lock outlives this process
and stays with the shell. A holder sets `SD_GATE_SLOTS=0` for everything it
starts, so a gate inside a gate never waits on the slot its parent holds.

A queue stands in front of the slots (sd:2262). On 2026-10-01 about 14 gates
waited on hand-written copies of one load rule; when load fell, several read the
same quiet moment and started together, in no order. Now every waiter takes a
ticket, and only the head of the queue is admitted, under one `queue.lock`, and
only when the load rule holds. So the first to wait is the first to start, and
no two waiters share one free slot or one load reading. A ticket is `flock`ed
by its waiter, so a dead waiter's ticket is free and the next poll removes it.

`run` waits, runs one command, and frees the slot when it ends; `status` shows
who holds and who waits. `sd gate run` and `sd gate status` are the same verbs
with the machine settings read.

One pool for every caller (sd:2522). On 2026-10-03 the pack's own `make test`
counted 2 slots from its Makefile while `sd-check` counted the machine's 4, the
stdlib `run` ignored `sd.gate_slots`, and a gate that waited said how many
slots were busy but not who held them. Now every entry point takes its count
from `configured` with `sd.gate_slots` read (`count` prints it for the shell),
and a waiting gate names each holder, its directory and since when.

The count is the one limit (sd:2607). On 2026-10-03 three gates read a load
average of 124 while most cores idled: macOS counts threads waiting on the disk
in the load average, so the load rule held every waiter back while the CPU had
room. The load rule is now off unless `sd.gate_load_max` sets it; the starts
stay `sd.gate_settle_seconds` apart. A holder also exports the cap as
`SD_GATE_POOL_SIZE`, so the tests it runs size their workers to the pool.

The count does not bound one gate's CPU (sd:2726). On 2026-10-05 one Rust
gate under 2 slots drove the load to 185 on 16 cores: cargo builds and tests
on every core. A holder under a cap now sets `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`,
`RUST_TEST_THREADS` and `NEXTEST_TEST_THREADS` (cargo-nextest reads no other,
sd:2872) to its share, the cores over the cap; a lower value the caller set wins. A gate receipt binds them (`thread_caps`), since a suite can
pass on one thread and fail on eight.
`MAKEFLAGS` gets no `-j`: a Makefile that orders prerequisites by their
listing, as the pack's own `check` does, would run them at once.

Every waiter goes in the order it queued (sd:5409). sd:5078 admitted lane
gates first and had a builder's `run` refuse, exit 69, while a lane gate held
or waited. On 2026-10-19 three builders then waited 1.5 to 2 h: a lane gate
nearly always held a slot, and each time one ended the next queued before the
builder tried again. Now a builder's `run` queues as any waiter does, bounded
by its `--max-wait`, and no later lane gate overtakes it; a lane gate that
queued first still starts first. The slot count is the load bound for both.

A lane gate is `sd-check`'s own wait, the merge gate wherever it runs; its
ticket says `role: lane`, and while it holds slot N it holds a `flock` on
`slot.N.lane`, taken in the same admission step, with its label written in it,
so `status` names it; the kernel drops both when it dies. The key is not
sd:5078's `lane: true`, which that version's admission put first: a waiter
still running that code would wait for a lane ticket this version orders
behind it, and each would wait for the other. A lane gate still on that code
puts its own ticket first until it ends; nothing here can change that.

Stdlib only: the harness runs this file from a bare fixture copy.
