"""The pull-request body `sd-ship` publishes, read against the lines it owns (sd:1870).

`sd-ship` writes `Work:` into the body it publishes, and `Item:` and
`Delivers:` into the squash message. A supplied `Item:`, `Work:` or
`Delivers:` line is stripped and named in the result, whatever it says
(sd:2999): `sd-ship` writes the links itself.

The fixpoint is the point: `normalize` of a body `sd-ship` published returns
the body it published before appending `Work:`, so the live pull-request body
fed back as `--body-file` prepares again without a refusal. Before this, the
body `sd-ship` itself wrote was refused as input (#1236, #1238).

Only a line at column zero is read, because that is the only form git or
rule 5 reads; an indented line is prose about a trailer, and the body keeps
it. A body with no item owns nothing, so every column-zero owned line is
stripped there, `Closes:` included.

With an item, a body `Closes:` line is refused: the enqueue's `--item` list
is the one closing set (operator ruling 2026-10-13, sd:3704, replacing the
sd:1481 body line). `Refs:` is not owned: it names related items, which stay
open.

A column-zero owned line inside a fenced code block or an HTML comment is
refused too, rather than kept: the squash carries the body as written, and
`sd_lib.demoted_trailers` would refuse the line there, at merge. Indented,
it is prose like any other example.
