"""The release chain a merge owes in a repository whose policy declares `release` (sd:6881, sd:7014).

docs/work/2026-11-01-release-bump-merge/design.md § Failure table. After the lane lands a PR it runs the chain
one step at a time, as far as it can go now, and stores where it stopped on the merged entry, so the next run
resumes there:

    version  the next semver from the Conventional Commit types since the last tag (`release_types`)
    tag      push the tag on origin's main                       asks when the policy holds `push` at ask
    bump     a PR in `deploy_repo` setting `key` in `file`      asks when the deploy repo holds `commit`,
                                                                 `push` or `pr` at ask
    merge    merge that PR once the deploy policy's gates pass   asks when the deploy repo holds `push` at ask;
             the step ends only when GitHub reads the PR MERGED, so a merge queue holds it
    verify   run `verify` in a detached worktree at the merged deploy commit, or the tagged one when no
             `deploy_repo` is declared, with SD_RELEASE_TAG and SD_RELEASE_VERSION; a failure reports, never
             rolls back

A freeze window (`sd-db repo freeze`) holds every act: the tag on the source, the merge on both repositories.
A step that fails or waits keeps its step; only `done` and `stopped` end a chain. An ask files one question on
the item; a ruling on it that starts with `go` or `yes` runs the step, any other stops the chain.
