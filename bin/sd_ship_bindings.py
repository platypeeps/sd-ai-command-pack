# Every file the review gate reads belongs to exactly one class (sd:1834,
# `docs/work/2026-09-29-review-binding-semantics/design.md`).
#
# `verdict` is the code that ran inside the `sd-review` process, plus the argv
# `sd-ship` hands it: it chose the providers, built the prompt, ran the
# deterministic check and parsed the findings. A receipt cannot be re-derived,
# so a change here moves the binding. It is hashed with comments and
# docstrings removed; every other string literal stays, prompt text included.
#
# `gate` and `check` run again on every `prepare` and `merge` against the
# stored report, and the merge gate runs the repository's check again at the
# landing head. A change there already applies to an old receipt, so it stays
# out of the digest. Their hashes are recorded so a moved binding names them.
#
# The tuples are hand-maintained. `tests/test_sd_workflow_state.py` walks the
# imports of `sd-ship`, `sd-review` and `sd-check` and fails naming any module
# that is in no class and not in `IMPORT_EXEMPT` -- `sd_protection.py` was a
# silent gap for a day (sd:1327 review, finding 3), `sd_jev.py` and
# `sd_opencode.py` for longer (sd:1834).
