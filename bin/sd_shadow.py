"""`sd shadow sync` — the verb over the collector the library already ships.

`sd_db.shadow_sync`'s own docstring settles the split in as many words: "This
module is the collector, not the command. `sd shadow sync` is a verb and verbs
live in the pack." So nothing here collects. It opens the connection, calls
`sd_db.sync_shadow`, and turns the `Synced` it gets back into a line an
operator can act on.

The one thing worth stating twice is the order the collector guarantees and
this verb must not obscure: rows are written whether or not the collect
succeeded, because a partial answer is still true, and the watermark moves only
on the collect's own success. A run that reports "wrote 4, cursor held" is
therefore not a contradiction -- it is the design -- and the report says both
numbers rather than one summary word that would have to pick.

The verb runs once per tracker the library names in `sd_db.TRACKERS`, in the
library's order, and prefixes every line with `shadow sync[<tracker>]:` so a
log with two blocks reads as two. A tracker whose variables are unset is one
`not collected (<reason>)` line and exit 0, `--strict` or not: an absent
configuration is not a failed collect. `--since` and `--until` bound GitHub
alone -- Jira's window is relative minutes and cannot express them -- so a
recovery run prints `skipped (recovery window is GitHub's)` for every other
tracker (sd:361, the 2026-09-12 decision in its design.md).

Nothing here closes anything. `sync` calls `collect`, `store` and
`write_watermark` and no fourth thing, which is why criterion 28's "the fixture
saw no close call" is a fact about the library rather than a rule this verb has
to keep.

    Two guards drop the two lines the verb has already put in its own words,
    and they are not symmetric. The reason line is matched by the FIELD that
    produced it: `result.reason` is the same string the library interpolated,
    so the guard cannot drift from it. The truncation line has no field to
    match -- `result.truncated` is the bucket list, not the sentence -- so
    that guard names a phrase the LIBRARY owns, `truncated buckets`.

    Each guard is also conditioned on the field, so a line is only ever
    considered for dropping when the verb in fact said it above.

    Matching a phrase is the deliberate choice here, because of which way it
    fails. If the library rewords its truncation line, the guard stops
    matching and the line is forwarded and printed TWICE. Dropping by
    position instead -- second line when truncated, third when not ok --
    would fail the other way, and silently eat a real line the moment the
    library stops emitting one. A duplicate is visible; a loss is not.

    The installed library decides how many lines there are. A pin that
    predates `queued` and `incomplete` simply yields fewer, which is why this
