"""Open followups for a checkout, read from the row through the library's brief.

Continuity used to come from one file. `bin/sd-handoff` wrote a packet, and
`bin/sd-handoff-restore` injected it -- but only if somebody had run the write
by hand, and nothing runs it automatically. A session that dies mid-task
leaves no packet, so the next one starts from nothing. That is the gap item A's
criterion 29 names: a session killed mid-task and restarted in the same
directory should begin from the followups it had named, with none lost.

A followup is already a durable row. `sd_db.add_note(kind='followup')` writes
one, `resolve_note` closes it, and the vocabulary is the `CHECK` on `note.kind`
rather than anything this pack declares. Nothing here has ever called either,
which is why the row is a continuity source in name only until this module
reads it back.

**This module exists because a suffixless file cannot be imported.**
`bin/sd-handoff-restore` and `bin/sd-note` both need the same two answers --
which item a directory means, and what is still open under it -- and Python
cannot import either from the other. Putting the pair here is one header paid
once instead of the same reader written twice and drifting.

**It reads and never claims.** The packet is claimed on injection, by rename,
so exactly one session gets it. A row is not: three sessions restarting in one
directory all deserve the same open followups, and a followup stops appearing
when the work is done and somebody resolves it -- not when a session happened
to read it. Nothing here writes.

**What is open is `sd_db.note_brief`'s answer, not a query here.** The hook
knows a directory and no item name. The library turns that into the
checked-out branch's item, or every live item of the repository when no
branch matches, and returns their open `followup` and `question` notes newest
first within eight kilobytes. This module carried its own query and renderer
for the same rows until sd:234's PR 10; `brief_for` below says why the second
reader went.

`sd_db` is imported inside the functions, not at module import, for
`bin/sd_restore.py`'s reason -- the library reaches this virtualenv through the
pack's installer, and before that has run every other verb and hook must keep
working. Callers differ in what they may say about its absence: `bin/sd-note`
prints the remedy, and a `SessionStart` hook must print nothing at all, so this
module raises and lets each caller decide.
