"""`sd fleet standard`: bring the repository the caller stands in to the managed-repo standard (sd:5610).

The standard is what the managed fleet holds today, read from its rows and
from GitHub (design: system `docs/work/2026-10-21-manage-standard/design.md`):

  * the sd-db row: `managed` yes, `runner_merge` auto, `ci` local, and the
    review declaration's `copilot_review.automatic_deep` false;
  * GitHub, for an owner in `sd.fleet_owners` only: squash commits built from
    PR_TITLE / PR_BODY, rebase merging off, head branches deleted on merge,
    Issues only where `repo.github_issues` takes them, no Wiki or Projects,
    secret scanning and push protection on a public repository, classic
    protection on the default branch (`sd/local-gate` strict, admins
    enforced, a pull request with 0 approvals), and Actions as `sd ci local`
    leaves them;
  * the checkout's untracked fleet files, as `sd fleet stamp` renders them.

Dependabot alerts are read and never written: alerts off is the operator's
kept choice (sd:5611), so it reads `ok` as "off", not as drift.

The run is a dry run unless `--apply` is given. The plan reads everything
first and gives each setting one step: `ok`, `change`, `pending` (a pull
request carries it), `skip` (with the reason) or `unknown` (a read failed;
nothing writes it). Every `change` step's write was decided by its own read,
so a second run finds `ok` where the first wrote. The steps run in order and
each in its own `try`, so one failure stops nothing after it. The row's
`managed` and `runner_merge` come last: the lane takes a repository up once
both say so, and a run that stops part way leaves it outside the lane.

Nothing here deletes: no ruleset is written or removed, no file is removed,
and a classic protection object that exists is changed only through its
sub-object endpoints, never rewritten whole from a read.

`--digest` binds an apply to the preview the operator saw: the plan is
rebuilt, and a different digest refuses with the new plan. The digest covers
the repository's identity (the row's path and remote, the checkout's origin,
GitHub's `full_name`, the default branch), which must name one repository,
and every step's key, state, before and after.
