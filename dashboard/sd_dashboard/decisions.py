"""Decisions: the questions that wait on the operator, answered with one button per option (sd:3012) or in words (sd:5064).

A decision is a `question` note whose body names its choices, one line each:

    Which store holds quick notes?
    Option: A pack store kind
    Option: Workflow database rows

`sd task note N "$(printf 'Q\\nOption: A\\nOption: B')" --kind question` writes one. A line that starts
`Option:` is a choice and every other line is the question. A repeated choice counts once. A question with fewer
than two choices is a free-text question (sd:5064): it lists here too, and the page answers it with a text box in
place of buttons. An old prose "Decision needed" comment stays a comment: it lists nothing here, because only a
`question` note asks.

- `document` is `/api/decisions`: every unresolved decision on an open item Tasks lists (`reads.backlog_items`,
  `reads.brief_notes`), and on a done item (`reads.open_notes`): closing an item answers none of its questions
  (pack sd:6329). The item's priority first, then the oldest, each with the revision `workflow.item_state` gives,
  read for every item in one `reads.revisions`.
  `recommended` is the index of the option the note recommends, or null (sd:5306): one option that ends
  "(Recommended)" or starts "(Recommended)" or "Recommended:", else a line "Recommendation: <text>" that names an
  option. A conditional "(Recommended only if …)" and two marked options recommend nothing.
  A question on a review batch (sd:3709, a task under a `review:` ref) is Scoring's: it is counted in `review`, and
  Decide's Decisions view draws one line that opens Scoring in place of its rows (sd:5781).
- `answer` is `/api/decisions/answer`, posted with the item, the note, the option and that revision: the CLI's two
  verbs in one transaction under the revision, as `sd task note N "<ruling>" --kind decision --answers <note>` writes.
  `workflow.add_item_note` writes the ruling, a `decision` note `Ruling on note #<note>: <option>`, and
  `workflow.resolve_item_note` resolves the question. A question with two choices or more takes only one of them;
  a free-text question takes any words. A stale revision writes nothing (`StaleItem`, a 409).
  `sd task show <item>` prints the ruling and the resolved question.

- `rulings` is the document's `rulings` (pack sd:6015): the `decision` notes of the last `RULINGS_DAYS`, one group per
  note session, newest group first, each ruling with its item, the item's state and the question it answered. A grill
  files many rulings in one session; the group reads them together.
- `reverse` is `/api/decisions/reverse`, posted with the item, the ruling note and the item revision: one transaction
  writes a `decision` note `Reversed ruling #<note>: question #<q> asks again.` and reopens question `<q>`
  (`writes.reopen_note`), so it waits in Decisions again with its options. Only a ruling that answered a question
  (`Ruling on note #<q>: ...`) reverses; a stale revision writes nothing.

Every read and write is an existing library call, so the installed sd_db serves it without a new install.
