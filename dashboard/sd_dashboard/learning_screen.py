"""Books and Videos: the rows behind the Documents page's Books and Videos views (sd:6260, sd:6261).

The page is `v2/documents.html`; it holds no rows. Each view reads one JSON document, `/api/documents/books` and
`/api/documents/videos`, built here from the vault's learning base rows (`records.list_rows(connection, "learning")`,
the `sdw.learning` kind). Nothing here writes: a row's stage and kind stay as the store holds them.

**Which rows.** A row moved to a view (`fields.document-type`, pack sd:6262) is in that view and no other, whatever
its content type: `sd-db records documents` moves it, and it then leaves Tasks and Today. Of the rest, Books are the
rows whose `content-type` is `book` or `article`. Videos are the rows whose `content-type` is `youtube` or `video`, and
any learning row titled `YYYY-MM-DD - YouTube - <channel> - <title>`, the name the vault's video notes carry. Other
learning rows (courses) are in neither.

**What one row says.** A book: its title, its author or source (the `author` list, else the `publisher`, else the
URL's host), its URL and its read state. A video: its title less the dated prefix, its channel (the `channel` field,
else the title's), its date (`published-date`, else the title's), its URL and its watched state. The state is the
row's stage in the page's words (`READ`, `WATCHED`); a stage the map does not name is shown as it is. A URL that is not
`http` or `https` is no link: `url` is empty and `url_text` keeps what the row holds, so the page shows it as text.

A store that does not read raises, so the route answers 500 with the cause and the page says the rows were not read.
