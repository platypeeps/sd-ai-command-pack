"""Tasks > Start next (sd:5107): queue a headless build of the next ready items, within the builder and load caps.

`plan` is what the dialog shows before anything is queued. The next items are the `ready` rows of
`reads.backlog_items`, in its order, less reports, items a Fix note says were started already, items a live Claude
session names (`claude_sessions`), items a Build press would refuse (`build._item`: an active assignment, a repository
that is not managed, has no remote or runs its lane elsewhere), and items whose repository is no directory on this Mac;
each one left out is in `skipped` with its reason. The room is the builder cap, `CAP` per machine, less the builders
running now (`claude_sessions.builders`), and none while the five-minute load is above `sd gate status --json`'s
`load_max`; a `load_max` of 0 is the load rule off (`build.over_load`, pack sd:6111).
A count or a load that could not be read is a refusal with its reason, never room.

`run` is the press, in steps, under `STARTING` (Build step 5, pack sd:6096; design: system
`docs/work/2026-10-24-build-dispatcher/design.md`):

1. A fresh `plan`. A refusal, any item asked for that is no longer in it, or more items than the room: nothing
   is queued, and the answer says why (a 400, `WorkflowError`).
2. `build.queue` with the revisions the dialog read: one queued build assignment per item, in one transaction, or
   none and a 409 naming the item it refused. A queued item has an active assignment, so a second run's plan leaves
   it out (step 1).
3. `builds.kickstart`, so the dispatcher claims in seconds. A kickstart that fails only says so; the job's next
   slot claims the rows. Herdr starts nothing here: Fix alone launches a session (operator, note #29486).
