"""Dashboard lists held as workflow database setting rows (sd:5109), each the pipe text its old file held.

`LISTS` names each list's row, its old file under `<config>/project-dashboard/` and what Settings says about it. The
readers (`places.realms`, `reports_screen.families`, `hoa_screen.thresholds`, `health_collectors.storage_list`) keep
their own grammar and read their text through `text`, the one rule:

- **Row wins.** A row the database holds is the answer; a cleared row (`None`) is "not configured", and the old file is
  not read again.
- The old file answers only for a list the database has never held, so the first Save on Settings is the import.
- A failed row read is unknown: `text` names it, and no file is read in its place.

`digest` is what a Settings save's `before` must equal: the source and text the page showed (as Home's tiles, sd:3987).
