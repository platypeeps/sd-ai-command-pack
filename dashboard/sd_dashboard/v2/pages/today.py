"""Today (sd:2110, the default since sd:2163): /api/now as one page, served from server.py's chain. The old Today, kept
under /classic/ when this page took `/`, was retired in sd:3402. Decisions moved to Decide and GitHub with Your issues to
GitHub (sd:5781). The Status view and its /api/today/status went with the tabs (sd:5921): `sd today` prints the sections.

The Queue view (pack sd:7234; the Queue page until then, sd:2585) reads each repository's ship lane from /api/queue
(`queue_screen`). Up, down, top, hold, release and cancel, a blocked row's retry and approve, a cancelled row's Re-queue
and a running row's Release post /api/queue/move, which runs `sd-ship lane move|hold|release|cancel|retry` and nothing
else. The build runs read /api/queue/builds (`builds.panel`), with ?show=all the ended runs too (pack sd:6834); a blocked
or cancelled run's Retry posts /api/queue/builds/retry, and its Send to builder posts the same route with a `finding`
(pack sd:6020); a running build's Cancel posts the assignment cancel route that exists. Auto-pickup's On and Off post
/api/queue/builds/pickup (`builds.pickup`, pack sd:6097). The runner assignments (pack
sd:7115, sd:7217) read /api/queue/runner (`queue_screen.runner`)."""
