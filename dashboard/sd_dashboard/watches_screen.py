"""Watches (sd:6264): the company and product watches, the store's market rows, on their own page.

The page is `v2/watches.html`; it holds no rows. It reads one JSON document, `/api/watches`, built here:

- `rows`: every `sdw.market` row (`records.list_rows(connection, "market")`). Each has its title, its status (the
  row's stage: candidate, active, paused or declined), its kind (`content-type`), area and description, the first
  http(s) link in its `## Sources` section (`url_text` instead when it does not parse), and its last refresh: the newest `Last full refresh: YYYY-MM-DD` the
  market-watch routine writes into the body (`refreshed`, "" for none) and its age in days.
- `fresh` says what that date is worth: `fresh` (active, refreshed within `STALE_DAYS`), `stale` (active, older),
  `never` (active, no refresh date: no profile yet) or `idle` (not active: the routine refreshes active watches only).
  A date is never shown as fresh past `STALE_DAYS`, whatever the job's last run said.
- `job`: the market-watch job (`JOB`) as HOA reads its refresh jobs (`hoa_screen.JOB_KEYS`): its launchd state,
  revision and Run now capability, its last run's stamp (`management_screen.last_run`) and the last line its run
  printed (`said`), which is why a failed run failed. A job that is not installed is `{"name", "error"}`.

Nothing here writes. Refresh all posts `/api/jobs/market-watch/retry`; Refresh and Add watch post `/api/actions/run`
(`watch.refresh`, `watch.add` in `run_actions`). A store that does not read raises, so the route answers 500 with the
cause and the page says the watches were not read.
