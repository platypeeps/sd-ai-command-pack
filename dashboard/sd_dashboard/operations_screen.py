"""Operations moved (pack sd:7517): where each of its areas went, and the helpers other screens import.

Every area moved to the page that holds its subject. The Jobs, Ports, Progress, Reports, Repos and Commands areas were
retired in sd:3402, once Management, Health, Metrics, Reports and Activity carried their controls; an address naming
one is a 404. Services and Sessions moved to Management in pack sd:7517, Usage to Metrics in pack sd:7524, Resources'
four views to Management, Notes and Tasks in pack sd:7527, and Trackers to GitHub's Tracked view in pack sd:7525
(`MOVED`, `MOVED_RESOURCES`): `server` answers an address naming one with a 301 to the view that holds it now
(`moved_to`). The bare address draws `moved_page`, a list of those homes, since only the browser sees an old
`#view=<area>`: `/ui/operations.js` follows the link that names it, and Trackers' with none, the area it opened on.
