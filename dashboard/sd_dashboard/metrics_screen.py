"""Metrics: the readings behind the default UI's Metrics page (sd:2119).

The page is `v2/metrics.html`; it holds no data. It reads one JSON document,
`/api/metrics`, built here by `document` from the reads the retired Usage and
Progress areas made:

- `usage`: the month as `sd usage --json` prints it (`usage.read`), so the
  page and the CLI cannot disagree about a dollar (requirement 6). Dollars are
  the month to date, not a week: a week of spend would be a second computation
  of the same ledger. `?month=` names another month (pack sd:7524).
- `trend`: the last 7-day-window meter reading of each day for the last week
  (`reads.meter_days`).
- `numbers`: the week's four numbers (`reads.weekly_numbers`).
- `scorecard`: the providers this month (`reads.scorecard`).
- `age`: open items by days in their current status (`reads.age_histogram`).
- `observed`: observed workflow activity (`reporting.metrics`).
- `ci`: the lane's gate runs over the page's range (`CI_DAYS`), per repository, and the flaky heads (`_ci`, sd:5473).
- `lanes`: each managed repository's lane over the last 7 days (`times`, pack sd:6006, moved from Queue in pack
  sd:7233): the median wait from enqueue to claim, the median gate time (the speculative gate plus the prepare step)
  and the slowest entry, enqueue to end, read from each entry's history rows by the pack's `sd_lane.lane_times`. A
  median wait past the 30 min target (pack sd:7412) is `over`: the lane runner files the parallel-lanes question
  then. The range leaves it at 7 days, as it leaves Age.
- `controls`: the provider registry as `provider_controls.snapshot` reads it, with its `revision`, and per bill the
  one cap write the route takes (`_writes`, sd:3387).
- `range`: the page's range, `7d` or `6mo` (`RANGES`, pack sd:7208). With `6mo`, `ranged` holds the parts the range
  changes, read over the last six calendar months, this one to date (`_ranged`): `spend`, dollars by bill per month,
  one `usage.read` a month; `scorecard`, the providers' six months; `ci`, the gate runs since the first month began.
  The parts above stay as `7d` reads them, so the lamps and the rail badge do not move with the range.

`usage` and `numbers` take seconds (`SLOW`): the served dashboard keeps them in a snapshot, and each then carries
`observed`, when it was read, and `stale`, why its newest read failed (sd:4955). A stale month lights no lamp.

Each part is guarded on its own: one that raises is that part's `error`, and
the others still answer. `unread` names the design's panels no reader covers,
with the reason, so the page shows them as unknown and never as empty.
Nothing here writes or reaches the network. The page's Cap and Configure post `controls.revision` to
`/api/bills/<bill>/cap` and `/api/providers/configure` (`server.action_route`), whose library refuses it once the
registry, a bill's cap or the order policy changed since this read.
