"""Briefs and problem reports on Today: what the reports view used to push by ntfy or mail (operator ruling 2026-10-17).

Two lists, read from the workflow database and from nothing else:

- `problems`: every open report that asks for a person. A report row (kind `report`, any source but `brief`) that is not
  `done` and whose `fields.attention` is not false: a non-zero exit, an `SD_REPORT_ATTENTION:` line, or fields nobody can
  read, which is for a person to look at as well (`reporting.UNREADABLE_FIELDS`). A quiet run report is left out, as the
  backlog leaves it out. Acknowledge posts the Reports page's route, `/api/reports/<id>/acknowledge`, with the revision.
  A report whose output shows an expired login carries `login` (`job_failures.login`), which Fix opens (sd:6964).
  Fix on any other report is the Reports page's debug session (pack sd:7683). A report another session already took
  carries `claim`, who has it: `in_progress`, by its status change's `who`, or a note Fix wrote (`fix_session.NOTE`)
  in the last `CLAIM_HOURS`, by that note's session; Today then names it in place of Fix.
- `briefs`: the routine briefs (`briefs_screen`) filed in the last `WINDOW_DAYS` days, newest first, that the operator has
  not marked seen. Seen is a Today snooze (`snooze`), key `today:brief:<stem>`, held until the brief changes
  (`writes.SNOOZE_FOREVER`, sd:5752): the place pages' Briefs (`places.briefs`) read the same mark (`seen_row`), so a brief
  seen in either place stays seen in both. A brief whose text grows (an `extend`) reads as new again, since its word
  count is its problem. No new store: the snooze is the existing one.

A read that fails is its reason (`problems_error`, `briefs_error`), never an empty list. Nothing here writes.
