"""Fix (sd:3456): one click on a task or a problem report starts a claude session for it in the operator's herdr session.

The operator ruled on 2026-10-12 (a note on sd:3456): Fix on a task starts a builder session for that task, and Fix on
a report (kind `report`) starts a debug and fix session for that report. Tasks, Reports and Today post
`/api/items/<id>/fix` with the item revision they read; `request` checks the body before the server opens a writer, and
`start` runs in the write, in three steps:

1. The item as it is now. Its revision must be the one the page read (`StaleItem`, a 409), so a second click from the
   same page, after the first one's note landed, starts nothing. It must be open, and its checkout a directory: a
   task's checkout is its repo, and a report's is its repo, else this checkout, which holds `local-cron-jobs`, since no
   report names its job's repo.
2. `local-herdr/herdr.sh launch <checkout> sd-<id> <prompt>`: a new herdr workspace with claude in it, given the
   prompt as typed text. The call is an argv, never a shell line, and the prompt is fixed text and the integer id,
   never the item's title. herdr missing or its session down answers 503 with herdr.sh's own words, which name
   `herdr.sh start`; nothing falls back to a hidden process. A later step that fails says what it left: a workspace at
   its shell prompt, or claude without its prompt. No answer within `TIMEOUT` is a 504 that says whether a session
   started is not known.
3. A comment note on the item names the session, the pane and the checkout. A note that cannot be written after a
   launch answers 503 naming the pane, so the operator knows a session runs without its record.

`LAUNCHING` holds one launch at a time, so two clicks that cross pass step 1 one after the other: the second then reads
the first one's note in the revision and is refused.

**Grill and Apply answers on a piece** (pack sd:6700). Writing posts `/api/items/<id>/fix` with `{"grill": "ask"}`:
step 2 starts claude on `GRILL`, which reads the draft and writes 5 to 10 question notes on the piece; the author
answers them on Writing's Details through `/api/decisions/answer`. `{"grill": "apply"}` starts claude on `ANSWERS`,
which edits the draft to follow each ruling and leaves the edit uncommitted; it is refused while a question is open or
before one is answered.

**Apply review on a piece** (pack sd:6699). Writing posts `/api/items/<id>/fix` with `{"apply": "adversarial"}` for a
piece whose `adversarial.md` digest stamp names the current draft (pack sd:6977): step 2 then starts claude on `APPLY`,
which edits the draft for each finding or rejects it with a reason, records each with `sd writing reconcile`, and
leaves the edit an uncommitted diff in the piece's repository. It commits, stages and publishes nothing.

**Fix on a Today Now row** (sd:5652). Today posts `/api/now/fix` with a Now row's id for the rows no other command
addresses: a repo ahead, dirty or pinned, the abandoned worktrees, and every dark row but the pull request collector's
(a failed job shows Run now, a pull request Open on GitHub and the pull request collector Re-run collector, each
under its own name, sd:6709). `start_row` reads that source again and launches only while the read still raises the row: a row it no longer
raises is `StaleItem` (409), and a read that failed says whether the row stands is not known (503). A dark row, whole or
in part (sd:5954), is confirmed by Today's own read, `now_screen.document`, which turns each failed read into its dark
row. A repo row starts in the checkout that read names; the rest start in this checkout.
The launch is step 2 above, on `row_prompt`'s fixed text for the row's kind; no fleet value enters the prompt. No note
is written: a Now row has no item, and herdr's workspace `fix-<kind>[-<name>]` is the record.
