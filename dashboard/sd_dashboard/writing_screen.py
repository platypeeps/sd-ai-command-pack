"""Writing pieces: `document` feeds /api/writing (sd:2125); the old screen was retired in sd:3402.

`document` is each piece's stage, gates and next moves as `writing.piece_state` gives them, its files' sizes, and its
draft up to `DRAFT_CHARS` (pack sd:7242). The repository goes out by its folder name only, so no local path leaves. Its `attention` is the
page's rail badge (sd:3446, `_attention`). Each piece's `realm` is `places.realm_of` of its repo, the rule Tasks' Realm
filter uses (sd:5064). Its `grill` is its open question notes and the count of its rulings (pack sd:6700): Details
walks the questions, and Apply answers waits until none is open. Its `ideas` are the vault's inbox blog ideas
(pack sd:7244), the `sdw.blog-idea` rows `records.list_rows` reads, highest score first: IDEAS of them beside the inbox
count, each with a link only for http. A failed read is unknown with its reason, never an empty inbox. Each idea's
`area` (pack sd:7670) is one of `AREAS`, read from its `contexts` field, the vault's Personal-or-Work axis (`area`
holds its topic); another value or none is no area (""). `areas` counts each, and `rows` holds the highest IDEAS
overall and of each area, so the column filtered to one area still shows that area's best. Its `mirror` is
the Drive folder its stage mirrors to and each mirrored file's Drive copies (`publishing.piece_mirror`, pack sd:7243);
a queue not read is unknown with its reason.
