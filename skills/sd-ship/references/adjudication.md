# Recorded rebuttals

Read this before recording dispositions for blocking findings.
Use it only for a complete review of the exact clean head whose deterministic checks passed or did not run.
A blocking review runs no gate, so its `check.status` is `not_run` (sd:2605).
It records rebuttals and parked risks; neither needs operator acceptance.
It waives no missing depth, incomplete transport, failed check, or source change.
A fix needs verification on its new head.
Record a rejection that survives one review pass here before the next fix is pushed (`skills/sd-ship/SKILL.md`, Recorded rebuttals).
For itemless records, replace `--item ID` below with `--no-item --review-id ID`.

1. Run `sd-ship adjudicate --item ID --expected-head SHA --json`.
   Save the returned `proposal` outside the checkout.
   Preserve its bindings and every indexed raw finding.
2. Fill each blocking finding's `response_disposition` and `reason`.
   A finding names a defect class, not only a line: before you fix or rebut it, check every sibling site of the same shape.
   A fix at the reported line alone leaves the class live at its siblings.
   Use `rebutted` for a rejection, with a reason a reader can check.
   Use `parked` for an accepted risk, with a reason that says when to revisit it.
   A cosmetic finding is `rebutted` with a reason that starts `cosmetic:` and says why no behaviour changes.
   Cosmetic means the fix changes no behaviour and no action a reader takes; contract text is never cosmetic.
   Nobody fixes a cosmetic finding, and it gets no follow-up row.
   Identical findings keep separate indices and decisions.
3. Record it with `sd-ship adjudicate --item ID --expected-head SHA --dispositions-file FILE --json`.
   This validates the file and records it at once; it calls no provider.
4. Resume `sd-ship prepare --item ID --json`.
   A recorded disposition reuses completed coverage without another review reservation.
   When the report's gate did not run, this prepare runs it at the head before clearance and records `adjudicated_gate`.
   A failing gate refuses clearance and keeps the spent pass; fix it and prepare again, which reviews the fix.
   For itemless records, `sd-ship review --no-item --review-id ID` runs it; `verify-review` only reads the record.

The record binds repository, branch, review identity, head, complete history, raw report, and finding indices.
It separately binds review tools/policy and disposition tools/policy.
Prepare and merge revalidate these identities; a later recording needs a fresh prepare.
Blank, unresolved, or `addressed` responses cannot substitute for fix verification.

Raw reports, severities, exit codes, and spent reservations remain unchanged.
The checkpoint reports `review_clearance.kind: adjudicated`, not a clean raw review.
CI, ownership, protection, and separate merge authority remain required.
