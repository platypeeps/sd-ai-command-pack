# Research repo conventions

Applies to this repo. Full standard: run `sd-research-kit conventions` for its path,
or read it in the pack at `skills/sd-research-repo/references/conventions.md`.

This file was laid once by `sd-research-kit init-claude-md` and is never re-laid.
`sd-research-kit review` reports where it has fallen behind the pack's template; a
section this repo states differently on purpose goes under `## Local overrides of the
shared template`, with the reason.

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `00-overview/` | `understanding.md`, `open-questions.md`, `next-research.md` — fixed names |
| `10-sources/` | `registry.md` (what was read, when, status), `references.md` (link list) |
| `20-map/` | `MAP-*.md` — structured ledgers, crosswalks, comparisons |
| `30-brief/` | `BRIEF-*` argued positions · `REVIEW-*` assessments · `SUMMARY-*` condensations |
| `40-docs/` | `PRD-` `DESIGN-` `PLAN-` `SPIKE-` `DISCOVERY-` `BENCHMARK-` `DECK-` `OUTREACH-` |
| `90-scratch/` | Throwaway and superseded. Never cited. |
| `docs/dashboard/` | Rendered HTML, served by the dashboard. Generated — never hand-edit. Gitignored. |
| `vendor/` | Third-party clones. Gitignored. |

Use only the directories this repo needs; do not invent new ones.

## Main document — START HERE

Choose exactly one main document titled `START HERE — <descriptive project or decision title>`.
Apply this during setup and the next update to an existing project.
Match its Markdown H1 to the `research.conf.py` `title` and `h1`.

Follow the full standard's **Main document — START HERE** section.

## Documents

Every document opens with an H1, a provenance paragraph, then `---`:

```markdown
# Title

Compiled 2026-08-27 from `owner/repo` @ `abc1234`, plus <other sources>.

---

## 1. First section
```

- `##` headings become the rail nav. Number them when order matters.
- State what is **verified** and what is **not verified** in a closing Status section.
- Corrections stay visible — say what changed and why, do not silently overwrite.

## Rendering

```bash
sd-research-kit render
```

Add or edit pages in `research.conf.py`, never by editing generated files.

## Adversarial review before publishing

```bash
sd-research-kit review
```

It checks provenance blocks, Status sections and build freshness, then prints the checklist
for the half no script can do. Exit 1 means fix it first.

Record the outcome in the Status section: what was verified and how, what was not, what was
cut, and the second reader's pass — which reader, date, what it raised, what changed, what
was rejected and why. A review that found nothing says what it checked.

## Publishing — local by default, mirrors on request

`sd-research-kit render` publishes every overview, map, brief, report, and survey twice.
Both copies are local: Markdown in the Obsidian vault, HTML on the dashboard's Documents
tab. That is the whole of publication for most documents. `90-scratch/` is not published.

**Do not publish research as an artifact.**

An outward mirror is opt-in, per document. The user designates a document. Record the
designation as a `notion=` or `drive=` key in that document's `research.conf.py` entry.

By default a designated document mirrors into this repo's own page or folder at that
destination — put its URL here when the repo designates one.

## Parallel work

Reading fans out to read-only subagents; writing stays in one lane, one writer per
checkout. Give each subagent a budget and a deadline, and treat no report by the
deadline as a failure. The rules are the pack's `WORKFLOW.md` section **Parallel work**
and `skills/_shared/references/subagent-dispatch.md`.

Subagents return findings as text. Inside a subagent, Claude Code's `Write` tool refuses
a basename matching `/^(REPORT|SUMMARY|FINDINGS|ANALYSIS).*\.md$/i`. Name scratch files
for their subject, such as `source-notes.md`. The main thread writes `30-brief/SUMMARY-*`.

## Style

- Absolute paths when pointing at a local file: `file:///Users/...`, not a bare path.
- Prefer a number with its validation status over an adjective.
- One claim, one source. If it came from Jira, cite the ticket; from code, cite `file:line`.
