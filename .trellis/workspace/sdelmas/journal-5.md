## Session 202: Remove redundant PR 232 recovery stash

**Date**: 2026-07-23
**Task**: Remove redundant PR 232 recovery stash
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Proved the sole rebase safety stash contained no unique work and removed it without applying stale content to merged main.

### Main Changes

- Compared all 23 stashed working-tree paths with merged main, including tree modes; 19 matched exactly and four were superseded by reviewed corrections, upstream release history, regenerated candidate evidence, and archived task state.
- Verified the staged snapshot was an earlier subset of the final working snapshot and the untracked parent was Git's empty tree.
- Dropped only stash object bf8529654a3f5d25551f7e3038cc7ececeeb95ac and preserved a clean synchronized main checkout.


### Git Commits

(No commits - planning session)

### Testing

- [OK] Review preflight passed with zero failures and zero warnings.
- [OK] git stash list is empty and repository status reports stash count zero.
- [OK] No code, consumer repository, or unrelated worktree content was changed.

### Status

[OK] **Completed**

### Next Steps

- None - task complete
