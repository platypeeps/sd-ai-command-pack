# Quality Guidelines

## Overview

Prefer small, explicit stdlib Python over framework code. The installer should
remain easy to audit because it writes files into other repositories.

## Forbidden Patterns

- Do not overwrite user files unless `--force` is set.
- Do not overwrite an existing `.prism/rules.json` or report it as a conflict;
  preserve repo-specific review rules during pack refreshes.
- Do not stage, commit, or modify the target repo beyond the manifest-listed
  files.
- Do not duplicate platform install rules in several places; update
  `manifest.json` and let `selected_files()` apply the rules.
- Do not replace structured parsing with ad hoc string parsing for JSON.
- Do not reintroduce install-time legacy or obsolete cleanup in `install.py`;
  legacy artifacts are advisory-only, reported by the install audit's
  `LEGACY_PACK_PATHS` / `LEGACY_PACK_REFERENCES` scans (see
  manifest-and-filesystem.md, Legacy And Obsolete Artifact Advisories).

## Silent Paths Must Say Why

Adopted 2026-07-06. Any code path that intentionally does nothing must print a
one-line reason: a skipped platform install, a no-op refresh, an empty scan,
a disabled or short-circuited gate. Silence is indistinguishable from success
and from breakage. The 2026-07-06 deep review found four independent defects
of this shape (silent marker-miss adapter skips, a review gate exiting 0 via
symlink without running, a learnings scan reporting OK after scanning
nothing, CI staying green over skipped tests).

- Good: `warn "No changed files remain after standard review-scan exclusions; skipping Gito review."`
- Bad: `return 0` out of a gate because a tool or input was missing, with no
  output.

## Required Patterns

- Use `pathlib.Path` for filesystem work.
- Keep pack files declared in `manifest.json`.
- Validate manifest paths before deriving target destinations or anchors.
- Treat Windows drive/root anchors and backslash-separated parent traversal as
  unsafe manifest paths, even when tests run on POSIX.
- Validate resolved pack source paths so template symlinks cannot escape the
  pack root.
- Validate resolved write and backup paths so target-repo symlinks cannot
  redirect installer writes outside the target repo.
- Reject occupied non-file target paths with a controlled installer error.
- Keep platform selection behavior covered by tests when adding adapters or
  install modes.
- Run `git diff --check` against installed target paths after writes unless
  `--skip-diff-check` is requested.
- Keep force-overwrite behavior covered by tests, including backup behavior
  when `--backup` is used.

## Testing Requirements

Run the installer tests with:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Add or update tests when changing:

- CLI flags or argument behavior
- conflict and force handling
- backup behavior
- platform selection and anchor rules
- manifest path validation
- template paths or manifest semantics

## Code Review Checklist

- Does the change preserve existing target files by default?
- Are manifest `source`, `target`, and `anchor` paths validated before any
  file writes?
- Are resolved pack source paths still inside the pack root?
- Are resolved destination and backup paths still inside the target repo?
- Do occupied directories, broken symlinks, and other non-file target paths
  fail without a traceback?
- Are new templates listed in `manifest.json` and documented in `README.md`?
- Do tests exercise the behavior through the CLI, not only helper functions?
- Does the installer still work with only Python 3.10+ stdlib dependencies?
- Is terminal output concise and stable enough for users to understand failures?
