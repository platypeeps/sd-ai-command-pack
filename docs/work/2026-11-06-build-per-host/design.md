title: Build dispatch per lane host

# Design — build-per-host

The item's row holds status, progress and decisions; this page holds the shape.
The rulings are note #46608 on system sd:7932.

## Problem

The dashboard's Build refuses an item whose lane runs on a satellite:
"item N's lane runs on <host>; builds run on the hub only" (`build._repo_refusal`).
The operator wants to start those builds from the hub dashboard.
The satellite must build them itself, as only it runs that lane.
The database is the one channel: no SSH and no remote session.

Today one dispatcher, the hub's `build-dispatch` job, acts on every build run.
A second dispatcher on a satellite would reap, kill, watch and sweep the hub's runs,
and the hub's would probe a satellite pid on the hub and `kill_group` a hub pgid.

## Approach

A build run belongs to one host, read from `runner_run.owner` (ruling Q1).
A hub-lane run keeps `owner = "build-dispatch"`, the role, so a failover keeps it.
A satellite-lane run gets `owner = "build-dispatch@<lane_host>"`.
`build.run_host(owner)` is the part after `@`, or None for the hub.

`build.lane_hosts(connection)` is the set of lane hosts this machine builds for:
`{this_host()}` on a satellite, and `{None, this_host()}` on the hub.
A satellite is a machine with a `hub.json` whose connection the hub serves.
The file decides, not the transport: the wire harness runs the hub's tests
over a served connection, and they stay the hub's. A run is mine when its host is in that set.
That mirrors `ship._lane`: NULL is the hub's lane, a name is that machine's.
`build.lane_of(connection, host)` is the one rule for a single lane or run:
None (the hub's) for NULL and for this machine's own name on the hub, as
`sd_lane.ended_kind` reads it; the host's name otherwise. A satellite cannot
tell the hub's name, so it reads a lane named for the hub as another host's.

The hub settles another host's rows once that host goes quiet: no
`build-dispatch@<host>` beat under `STALE_SECONDS` (`build.dispatcher_gone`,
the press's check too). Its claim blocks such a queued row with that reason.
Its reap ends such an open run whose own beat is that old too, without a
probe or a signal: cancelled when a cancel was asked, else blocked and
released; a held run is released. A run at a lane step waits on that host's lane.

1. Press: `_repo_refusal` no longer refuses a lane host. A press queues for a
   satellite lane only while that host's `build-dispatch@<host>` beat is under
   `STALE_SECONDS` old; otherwise nothing there claims it and the item stays locked.
2. Claim: takes only queued rows whose repository's `lane_host` is in `lane_hosts`.
   It skips the others and blocks none; the claim writes the owner from the lane host.
3. Room: counts only this host's build and draft runs against `MACHINE_CAP`
   and `REPO_CAP` (ruling Q3). The interactive builders are this machine's already.
4. Dispatch, reap, held release, watch, sweep and the spawn loop act only on mine.
5. Drafts and auto-pickup stay on the hub (ruling Q2): `eligible` and `draft`
   refuse a satellite lane; a satellite tick runs no pickup, no draft claim or reap,
   and no stop-on-blocks.
6. The failure push runs on the hub only, over every host's runs:
   one pusher sends each failure once, and the hub holds the notifier.
7. The tick's heartbeat key is `build-dispatch` on the hub and
   `build-dispatch@<host>` on a satellite, so one does not hide the other.
8. The Build dialog names "runs on <host>" for a satellite bundle, not the hub's room.
   The Builds panel row names the host and the log path, and reads no log
   on the hub's disk for it (ruling Q5).

Rejected: a `runner_run.host` column. It needs a migration, and the owner already
travels with every retry (`_settle`, `_health_unknown` copy it).

## Non-goals

- Auto-pickup and drafts for satellite lanes (ruling Q2).
- The system half: the job on the work satellite, its `SD_HUB_ONLY_AGENTS` entry,
  its log root (ruling Q4). That lands in the system repository after this.
- Live log reads of a satellite run from the hub.

## Failure table

```text
Step | State moved | Failure | Recovery | Test
Press | build assignment queued for a satellite-lane item | the old refusal | none needed: the press queues for any lane; other refusals still refuse the whole selection | test_build.Queue.test_press_queues_a_satellite_lane_item
Press, no dispatcher there | nothing: the press refuses | a press queues and locks items no dispatcher claims | the press and the plan refuse, naming the host, without a beat under STALE_SECONDS; the Build dialog shows the beat's age and the toast names the host that claims each row | test_build.Queue.test_a_press_for_a_satellite_whose_dispatcher_does_not_beat_refuses_and_locks_nothing, test_build_panel.BuildRoutes.test_a_satellite_press_names_its_host_and_starts_no_hub_tick
Claim on the hub | hub-lane rows claimed, owner build-dispatch | the hub claims or blocks a satellite row | the claim skips a row whose lane host is not its own; the row stays queued | test_build.Hosts.test_the_hub_claim_skips_a_satellite_row
Claim on a satellite | its rows claimed, owner build-dispatch@<host> | it claims a hub row or another satellite's | the same filter; the hub's rows stay queued | test_build.Hosts.test_a_satellite_claims_only_its_lane
Claim, lane moved before it | the row goes to the host that holds the lane at claim time | a stale host from the press | the claim reads lane_host in its own transaction | test_build.Hosts.test_a_lane_move_before_the_claim_moves_the_claim
Claim, load unread | nothing | gate_load() is None on a host | no claim; the tick's why names the unread load; the next tick reads again | test_build_run.Tick.test_an_unread_load_says_why
Room | builders counted per host | the hub's runs fill the satellite's cap, or the reverse | room counts only runs whose host is in lane_hosts | test_build.Hosts.test_room_counts_only_this_hosts_runs
Spawn | a supervisor started for an open run with none | the hub spawns a satellite run's supervisor on the hub | the spawn loop takes mine only | test_build_run.Hosts.test_each_tick_spawns_only_its_own_runs
Worktree, build, review, fix | the satellite's supervisor walks its steps on its disk | supervisor lost | the satellite's reap retries once; the retry keeps the owner | test_build.Hosts.test_a_retry_keeps_the_satellite_owner
Reap and kill | outcome, kill, settle | the hub probes a satellite pid or kills a hub pgid by its number | reap and held release take mine only; the satellite reaps its own | test_build.Hosts.test_the_hub_never_signals_or_reaps_a_satellite_run
Cancel from the hub | cancel_requested on the run | no satellite tick runs | the run stays open with the request; the satellite supervisor's beat or its reap ends it cancelled | test_build.Hosts.test_a_hub_cancel_lands_on_the_satellite_reap
Enqueue | lane entry on the satellite | the lane moved after the claim: sd-ship refuses (LaneElsewhere) | the run ends blocked with the refusal; Retry queues it, and the next claim goes to the new lane host | test_build_run.Supervise.test_a_body_the_lane_refuses_blocks_with_its_reason (the same refusal path)
Lane watch | enqueued to cleaning or lane_failed | the hub runs lane list for a satellite repo and probes its pids | watch takes mine only | test_build_run.Hosts.test_each_tick_watches_only_its_own_runs
Sweep | a done bundle's worktree removed | the hub removes a path that names a satellite worktree | sweep takes mine only | test_build_run.Hosts.test_sweep_leaves_another_hosts_worktree
Report back | notes, run row, cost rows in the one database | the hub stats a satellite log path | the panel row names host and log path and reads no log for it | test_build_panel.Panel.test_a_satellite_run_names_its_host
Push failure | one ntfy push per failed run or entry | hub and satellite both push one failure | push_failures returns nothing on a satellite; the hub pushes every host's | test_build_run.Hosts.test_a_satellite_pushes_nothing
Drafts and pickup | draft runs, auto-pickup queue | a satellite tick claims a draft or picks hub items | the satellite tick skips pickup, stop-on-blocks, draft claim and draft reap; eligible skips a satellite lane | test_build.Hosts.test_auto_pickup_skips_a_satellite_lane, test_build_run.Hosts.test_a_satellite_tick_runs_no_draft_or_pickup
Pickup, satellite press queued | nothing | a satellite press the hub never claims holds hub pickup, forever with no satellite dispatcher | pickup holds only for a queued press of this host's lanes | test_build.Hosts.test_a_satellite_press_leaves_the_hub_pickup_running
Host identity | which lanes this tick acts on | a served connection on the hub reads as a satellite: the wire run claims, reaps and pushes nothing | hub.json and a served connection make a satellite; no hub.json is the hub | test_build.Hosts.test_the_hub_over_the_wire_is_still_the_hub, test_build_run.Hosts.test_the_hub_over_the_wire_still_pushes, the wire run of test_build, test_build_run, test_draft
Heartbeat | state heartbeat row | the satellite's beat hides a dead hub job | the satellite beats build-dispatch@<host> | test_build_run.Hosts.test_a_satellite_tick_beats_its_own_key
Older state | runs from before this change | an owner with no @ | reads as the hub's, as before | the existing test_build and test_build_run suites
Hub-named lane, press | assignment queued | a lane named for the hub needs a build-dispatch@hub beat the hub never writes | _item reads lane_of: the hub's lane needs no beat | test_build.Hosts.test_a_lane_named_for_the_hub_takes_a_press_pickup_and_draft_on_the_hub
Hub-named lane, pickup and drafts | auto-pickup queue, draft runs | hub_only refuses the hub's own lane | _repo_refusal hub_only reads lane_of | the same test (eligible, draft.queue_if_eligible)
Hub-named lane, pickup hold | nothing | a hub-named press is not counted as this host's | the hold reads lane_of | test_build.Hosts.test_a_satellite_press_leaves_the_hub_pickup_running (hosts filter now via lane_of)
Hub-named lane, claim | run owner | the owner becomes build-dispatch@hub, so the panel hides its log | claim's filter and run_owner read lane_of: the bare role | test_build.Hosts.test_a_lane_named_for_the_hub_claims_with_the_hubs_bare_owner
Hub-named lane, dashboard | plan, press answer, panel rows | the plan shows no room and runs on hub, the answer skips the kickstart, the panel reads no log, for build-dispatch@hub rows from before too | plan, answer, open and ended rows read lane_of | test_build_panel.BuildsPanel.test_a_lane_named_for_the_hub_is_the_hubs_on_the_panel
Hub-named lane, run sets | room, reap, watch, sweep, spawn, push | none: lane_hosts on the hub holds None and its own name | unchanged | test_build.Hosts.test_lane_of_reads_this_hubs_own_name_as_the_hub
Foreign queued row, host quiet | the assignment blocked with why, item free | the hub skipped it forever with no note | the hub's claim blocks it when dispatcher_gone | test_build.Hosts.test_the_hub_blocks_a_quiet_satellites_queued_row_with_why
Foreign queued row, lane moved after the press | the same | moved to a host that never beat | the same check: no beat is gone | test_build.Hosts.test_the_hub_blocks_a_row_whose_lane_moved_to_a_host_that_never_beat
Foreign open run, host quiet | outcome blocked, run and lease released, items blocked and parked | stays open and locks its items | _strand: dispatcher_gone and no run beat for STALE_SECONDS; no probe, no signal | test_build.Hosts.test_the_hub_ends_a_quiet_satellites_run_blocked_and_releases_it
Foreign open run, cancel asked | outcome cancelled, items ready | cancel_requested waits for a tick that never comes | _strand ends it cancelled | test_build.Hosts.test_the_hub_completes_a_cancel_a_quiet_satellite_never_read
Foreign held run, host quiet | released_at, lease, park | a blocked run waits for that host's release | _strand releases it with a probe that answers gone | test_build.Hosts.test_the_hub_releases_a_quiet_satellites_held_run
Foreign run, supervisor still beats | nothing | the dispatcher died but its supervisor runs | the run's own beat keeps it | test_build.Hosts.test_the_hub_ends_a_quiet_satellites_run_blocked_and_releases_it (after=60)
Foreign run at a lane step | nothing | its branch waits on that host's lane | stays; that host's watch ends it when it returns | none: no state to settle here
Satellite returns after the hub ended its run | its supervisor's next write | it acts on a run the hub ended | build.write changes no row, so the supervisor stops; the run is released | test_build_run.Supervise.test_a_lost_run_stops_before_the_next_step
Rollback | the previous pack on the hub | its reap acts on every run and reads a live satellite pid as gone | before a rollback, cancel each open satellite run on the Builds panel and let the satellite end it | none: a procedure
```

## Acceptance criteria

- `python3 -m unittest tests.sd_db.test_build tests.sd_db.test_build_run tests.sd_db.test_draft` passes with 0 failures.
- `python3 -m unittest dashboard.tests.test_build_panel` passes with 0 failures.
- On `origin/main`, each new test above fails.

## Risks

- A satellite with no `build-dispatch` job leaves its rows queued for ever.
  The Build dialog names the host, and the system half installs the job.
- Two machines whose `hostname -s` agree would both claim one lane.
  `ship._lane` has the same rule; the lane host names are unique in the fleet.
- A rollback of the hub's pack while a satellite run is open is unsafe (last table row).
