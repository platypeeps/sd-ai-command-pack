title: Build an unmanaged repository's item to a draft pull request

# Design — unmanaged-build

## Problem

The Build press and auto-pickup refuse a ready item whose repository is
registered with `repo.managed = 0`: `build._repo_refusal` says "is not
managed". Such a repository belongs to someone else (memory-experiment
sd:7832 is one), so no lane, merge or pack file may reach it. The operator
ruled (sd:7868 note #46131) that a build there still runs: the same builder,
`sd-review --scope branch` and the repository's own tests, then a pushed
branch and a draft pull request that the owners merge.

## Approach

Keep the run's steps and their compare-and-sets; change what two steps do
when the run's repository reads unmanaged.

- Press and pickup: `_repo_refusal` drops the managed rule. An unmanaged
  repository instead needs a GitHub remote, and each item must be a
  `task`: its pull request is tracked as the task's contribution
  `pull_url`, which `contributions.configure` writes for tasks only.
- `reviewing`: `sd-review` already runs review-only there (its gate
  skips an unmanaged checkout, sd:5953). After a clean or advisory review
  the supervisor runs the repository's own checks, as `sd-check` detects
  them (`sd_lib.detect_entrypoints`: the local block, Makefile, Taskfile,
  package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml), each through `sd gate run`
  so it queues for a machine gate slot. A failure goes back to the
  builder as a blocker, as `gate_failed` does. So does a check that
  exits 0 but changes a tracked file (`git status --porcelain
  --untracked-files=no` not empty): it tested a tree the head does not
  hold, so publish would push an untested commit. No entrypoint found is
  noted on the lead item and is no failure.
- `enqueuing`: the same compare-and-set, delivery read, title check and
  `sd-docs-lint --pr-body`. Then, instead of `sd-ship lane enqueue`:
  `git push origin <head>:refs/heads/<branch>`, find the open pull
  request for that head branch with `gh pr list`, or open one with
  `gh pr create --draft`, then link it on the lead task with
  `contributions.configure(pull_url=...)`. The run's `detail` names the
  draft, and `build.enqueued` ends the members `done` with the lease
  released, as for the lane.
- Title and body: the builder writes both, as for the lane; the same
  line check and leak guard (`enqueue_refusals`) run before the review.
  That guard runs only where a pre-push hook names it, which an
  unmanaged repository lacks, so `publish` runs `leak-guard.sh scan`
  (`Tools.guard`) itself before the push: over the title, the body, and
  each commit's message, paths and added lines in base..head. A match,
  or a scan that cannot check (no pattern file is exit 3), blocks the
  run with nothing pushed. The scan runs only when the repository is
  public, the rule machine-setup uses for the pre-push guard (operator
  ruling): the owners of a private one already see work names. `gh repo
  view --json isPrivate` reads it; a visibility that did not read counts
  as public, so the scan runs. `sd-docs-lint` gets `--body-only` there, so a
  foreign docs tree cannot block the run.
- Reviewed head: no lane gate re-checks an unmanaged head, so
  `enqueuing` publishes only the head this supervisor's review and
  checks passed. A run resumed or retried at `enqueuing` goes back to
  `reviewing` first.
- Checks' processes: `sd gate run` starts its command in a process group
  of its own. Every stop reads, live from `ps`, the groups that the
  recorded group's descendants run in, and ends them with it: the
  supervisor's `end_group` (TERM, the grace, then KILL) and the reap's
  `kill_group` (KILL). A live read names only groups this run's processes
  started, so a recorded number a reused pid holds is never signalled.
  The supervisor also records each group with its leader's start, to end
  one that outlived its parent; it signals one only while that leader, or
  no leader, runs in it.
- `enqueued`: the tick's `watch` reads a run whose `detail` names a draft
  pull request from the contribution observation (`contribution_sync`
  observes every task `pull_url`), never the lane. Merged: the delivered
  tasks still `in_progress` move to `done`, and the run goes to
  `cleaning` (never `checking`: a merge in someone else's repository
  deploys nothing here). Closed without merge: the run ends
  `lane_failed`, its items left for the operator. Open: nothing.
- Item status: `in_progress` until the merge, as a lane-held item is.
  With sd:7859, Queue shows it as waiting on the pull request. A draft
  pull request the operator wrote, linked to an item, reads `awaiting_you`
  with the reason "Draft pull request: mark it ready for review", so the
  operator sees it until it is marked ready (note #46134). The Builds
  panel's Open PR link reads the lead task's `pull_url` when the run's
  repository is unmanaged.
- Dashboard (note #46134): Tasks Details gains a "Pull request" section
  for an item with a contribution `pull_url`: a link that opens it in a
  new tab, its observed state and lane, and a "Needs you" line with the
  projection's reasons while `needs_you` holds. Queue's row and its Open
  PR link come from sd:7859 ("blocked: PR · on you"), which reads the
  same lane; its DOM test for a draft follows once sd:7859 lands.
- The needs-you signal is the contribution lane `awaiting_you`, chosen
  over a new pr-attention report or a Queue-only state: Today's Needs
  you `prs` rows, the Contributions page and sd:7859's Queue "on you"
  all read that lane already, so one rule in `_projection_row` flags the
  draft everywhere with no new report kind or state.

Rejected: letting `sd-check` or `sd-ship` run in an unmanaged checkout.
Both refuse there on purpose (sd:2566), and `sd-ship` writes receipts and
merges. Rejected: a new run column for the mode. The run's `detail` is
unset on an open run until it ends, so it carries the draft's address at
`enqueued` with no schema change.

No new command, flag, setting or table. `Tools` gains two argv seams,
`gh` and `gate`, which tests fill with fakes.

## Non-goals

- No merge, no `sd/local-gate`, no lane entry, no ship receipt.
- No pack file written into the repository: the title and body live in
  the run's log folder; the worktree holds only the builder's commits.
- No `work` or `report` items in an unmanaged repository.
- No marking ready for review: the operator does that on GitHub.

Each git read the scan makes, by commit kind (review of 5a5adca64).
All three run `git log base..head` with `--no-renames`,
`--diff-merges=first-parent` and `log.showRoot=true`:

```text

How a run's check ends, one row per path. "Groups below" means the
groups that the recorded group's descendants run in, read live; the
check runs in one, under the gate. Each test is in test_build_run.

Not covered: a check that leaves a daemon in a new group and exits
before a reap. Nothing then ties it to the run; the lane's gate has
the same reach.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A press on a ready task in an unmanaged repository with a GitHub
  remote queues; `make test SUITE=sd_db` style focused runs of
  `tests/sd_db/test_build.py` pass.
- [ ] A supervised unmanaged run ends `enqueued` with a draft pull
  request, no `sd-ship` call, the branch on the fixture origin, and the
  lead task's `pull_url` set; `tests/sd_db/test_build_run.py` passes.
- [ ] Every managed-path test in both files passes unchanged.
- [ ] Tasks Details for a task with a draft pull request links it in
  a new tab and flags it as needing the operator; `test_v2_tasks`
  passes.

## Risks

- A push to a third-party remote publishes. It happens only in a build
  the operator pressed or auto-pickup they turned on; tests push to a
  fixture bare repository and fake `gh`.
- Commits carry `Closes: sd:N` trailers into the owners' history. The
  delivery read needs them; they name an item number, nothing private.
- The merge closes the items only once `contribution_sync` observes it,
  which runs on its own schedule.
- The draft's "needs you" reason waits for the first observation.
- The gate's exit 125 and 127 readings are pack sd:7899.
- Evidence: the watch ties a merge to the run by the pull request URL
  the run recorded and the observation keyed by that URL; the tests'
  pass is tied to the head the review read.
