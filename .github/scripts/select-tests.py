"""Pick the test modules a set of changed files needs, or say the suite does.

`make check CHANGED="<paths>"` hands its paths to `run-tests.sh`, which asks
this script what to run. It prints either the one line `full`, meaning run
every module, or the module names to run, one per line. Without `CHANGED` the
script is never asked and the full suite runs, which is sd:10 criterion 16:
the fast path is an argument, and the full suite stays the default.

Every doubt resolves to running more, never less:

* A path the full suite must answer for selects `full`: the `Makefile`,
  anything under `.github/`, the Python and dependency configuration, the
  installer (its coverage gate needs the whole suite), and anything under
  `tests/` that is not a test module, such as the coverage `sitecustomize`.
* A path no test module names selects `full`. So does a path outside the
  checkout, a directory, and a path that names more than half the modules
  outside the always-run set: that file is shared, and a fast path that runs
  most of the suite without its coverage gate is a slower full run that
  proves less.
* An empty list of paths selects `full`. `CHANGED=` and `CHANGED="   "` are
  what an operator produces by accident, from a diff that came back empty or
  failed, and a narrowed run that skips the coverage gates is the wrong answer
  to "I changed nothing I can name".
* The always-run set runs on every fast path. It is the modules that walk the
  whole tree rather than naming a file: shape, line caps, code health,
  citations, shell placement, the retired framework's name, verbs, workflow
  policy, the governed pathspec, the cut symbols, and the form every call to
  git's index lister declares. The set is not written here. A module that
  walks the tree declares it, with `ALWAYS_RUN_MARKER` on a line of its own,
  and this script greps for that -- so a whole-tree module joins the set by
  existing rather than by being remembered. It was a hand-typed tuple of nine
  names until sd:1389, and `tests/test_cut_symbols.py` was not one of them:
  the same kind of grep over the same tree as `test_no_trellis_residue`,
  which was. If no module carries the marker the set has drifted and the
  answer is `full`.

A test module is selected when its source names the changed path, its file
name, or its module stem, as a whole token. A change under `bin/` or
`dashboard/` also selects the tests that name any file there whose text
carries an `import` statement for it, followed to a fixed point. The closure
reads import statements and matches the changed file's stem, so it is empty
for a stem that is not a Python identifier: `import sd-pr-state` is not
something Python can say, so no hyphenated `bin/` tool is reachable through
the closure. No import scan could reach one -- such a tool is loaded by a
`SourceFileLoader` from a name held in a string -- so a hyphenated tool is
selected by the tests that write its name and by nothing else. A test that
reaches a file without naming it -- a walk of a whole directory, a script
reached through another script -- is not selected unless it is in the
always-run set. That is the price of a fast path, and it is why the full
suite still runs before a push, and why CI never runs this.
