"""`WORKFLOW.md` is the policy, and the payload agrees with it.

Six things drift silently and each has a test here.

**The override keys.** The `CLAUDE.local.md` block the installer writes and the
Overrides section of `WORKFLOW.md` describe the same set of keys. Neither is
checked against a list written down beside it: the expectation is enumerated
from `sd_lib.MODES`, `sd_lib.CHECK_NAMES` and `sd_lib.CONSENT_KEY` in the
source, so adding a sixth key to the library and to only one of the two pages
fails here.

**The review table.** It appears in exactly two files and the two copies are
byte-identical. A cap edited in one place and not the other is the failure this
catches; a third copy is the failure the count catches.

**The planning review rule.** Exactly one file states it. Every other file that
needs it links to that one.

**The deleted second-model lane.** It is named nowhere in the governed tree.
`CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/work/` are history and are excluded by name, since the
archive is kept unchanged and holds every name the cuts removed.

**The bare vendor token.** No file under `skills/` names `codex`, `claude`,
`openai` or `anthropic` as a bare token: a skill names a role or a registry
entry, and the registry maps it to a vendor. The grep was once zero and nothing
pinned it, so three tokens came back in `skills/sd-review/SKILL.md` unnoticed.

**The skills that run a review.** Each names its point in the review table and
reads the cap from the one rule file, and none carries a cap of its own. The
skills are enumerated from what their pages invoke, not from a list kept here.
