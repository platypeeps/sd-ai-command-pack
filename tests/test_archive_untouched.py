"""Criterion 21 history, the archive boundary, and pack deletion paths.

Two halves. The archive half: the retire changed nothing under `archive/`. The
code-path half, `NoDeletionPath` at the end: no sweep or park code path
remains, and the deletion verbs the tree does carry are a frozen set that
this file enumerates.

The `docs/work` retire removed every active item's `status:` line and wrote
`docs/work/.status-source`. Archived items keep their line, because they are
records of what was, and a migration that rewrote a record after the fact
would be the one failure this criterion exists to catch.

Two readings of "untouched", both here, because either alone fails open.

The *diff* reading is the criterion's own words: the commit that landed the
retire names no path under `docs/work/archive/`. It is the strongest form and
it needs the history to be present, so it fails rather than skips when the
commit is not reachable -- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` fetches the whole
history for that reason.

The 2026-09-17 removal changed only its reviewed first batch.
Git history preserves the removed records.
New archived `prd.md` files must still carry their historical `status:` line.
Active items must not carry one.
