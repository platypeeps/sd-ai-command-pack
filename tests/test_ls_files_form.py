"""Every call to git's index lister in this repository says what its form is.

sd:841. The index holds an unmerged path once per merge stage, so a plain
listing prints that path three times while somebody is resolving a conflict.
Whether that matters at a given call site ranges from nothing at all to a
wrong answer, and the way to find out is to read the site -- which is the
problem: there are three dozen of them, and nothing made a new one announce
itself.

`Makefile:67` has claimed since item 481 that "every `ls-files` in this
repository now says what it means". It was false by the time sd:823 found two
calls that did not, and sd:823's fix removed the count from the comment
without leaving anything that would fail when the next one landed. The review
of that change re-derived the inventory by hand and found the author's had
missed two sites. That is the whole argument for this file: the inventory is
not something a person can keep, so it is enumerated here instead, from the
index, every time the suite runs.

**What a site must carry.** One of the options that fixes git's output shape
-- `--deduplicate` for a list of paths, `-u`/`-s` for merge stages,
`--error-unmatch` for a probe, `--others` for what the index does not hold --
written on the same line as the subcommand, in the half of the line the call
itself is in. A call that is deliberately plain, because plain output is what
it is testing, says so in a comment and says why.

**Which half of the line.** A declaration has to be the thing the machine
does, not a sentence beside it. `run(["git", <subcommand>])  # --deduplicate`
asks for plain output and says the opposite, and a docstring that quotes the
plain marker while explaining it is prose, not an exemption. So the line is
split at the comment that opens on it: the option counts in the half the call
is in, and the marker counts only in the comment half. Without that split
either one is a text search over the whole line, and the guard is defeated by
writing the right words anywhere near the call -- which is worse than the
hand-written list it replaces, because it looks like a declaration.

**What this does not do**, stated rather than left to be discovered. It does
not decide whether a site chose the right form; a reader does that. It reads
source text, so a call whose subcommand arrives in a variable -- `argv =
["git", name]` -- is invisible to it, and a reviewer is the only thing
standing behind that; no site in this repository is written that way, and the
one place that would have been, `surface` below, is written out instead. It
covers tracked, non-prose files, so an untracked scratch file and a page under
`docs/` are both out of scope. What it does is make the choice visible and
refuse the absence of one, which is the part that was drifting.
