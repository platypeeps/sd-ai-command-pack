"""Every skill that writes a file in this tree names `sd-rules --for`.

sd:431 step 8, part (ii). The authoring tier is a verb, `sd-rules --for
<path>`, and a verb nobody calls enforces nothing: `design.md`'s tier table
says the skill "consults the registry and names the rule ids in scope", and
the owner's note of 2026-09-16 says where -- "skills call it in their setup
step". This module holds that link. Part (i), the verb, landed at #997 and is
tested in `tests/test_sd_rules_for.py`; part (iii), one teaching section per
live-row id, lands as the rows do and is held by leg a in
`tests/test_rule_registry.py`.

**Which skills.** `WRITER_SKILLS` is not typed from memory: it is the answer
`WRITES_A_FILE` gives over every tracked `skills/*/SKILL.md`, less the names
`NOT_WRITERS` holds with a reason each. The predicate is a write verb within
one clause of a file noun, which is how the audit of `8548d512` read the
skills -- sd-plan "Write from the templates", sd-spec "Rewrites the spec
pages", sd-debug "Edits in the tree", sd-handoff "writing any file the
packet's `files[]` lists", sd-humanizer "rewrite the file in place",
sd-technical-editor "Edit mode authorizes only the supplied draft". It is
looser than the audit's reading, on purpose: a predicate tight enough to match
only the six would be the list again, spelled as a regex. So it also matches
a skill that declares itself read-only in the negative ("Never write to a
file") and one that writes another repository's tree, and those are held in
`NOT_WRITERS` where a reviewer can read why. A seventh skill that writes a
file lands in neither set and `test_the_list_is_what_the_predicate_answers`
names it; a skill that leaves `NOT_WRITERS` for the tree without moving to
`WRITER_SKILLS` is named the same way.

**sd-review is not here.** Its `setup-github` writes `.github/`, which
`sd-rules` classes as code and answers with the `bin/`-shaped rows; the
audit left it out until that residue is settled, and the predicate does not
match it, so nothing here has to say so twice.

**Where the sentence is read from.** The whole page, fenced blocks removed:
every skill that carries the pointer carries it inline, as sd-check's two
teaching sections and sd-handoff's restore step do, and a pointer inside a
fence would be an example rather than an instruction.
