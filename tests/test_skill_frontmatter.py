"""The frontmatter contract for `skills/sd-*/SKILL.md`, asserted as it is written.

The design's taxonomy (design.md, "Taxonomy (r6 §1)") is a *behavioural* claim:
a COMMAND pre-authorizes side effects, so its invocation must be deliberate and
it sets `disable-model-invocation`; a SKILL is knowledge loaded when relevant and
carries no standing authority, so it must not; an AGENT is a bounded worker and
declares `tools:`. Rendered, that difference is three frontmatter keys, and
nothing in this repository checked them before this file existed.

The contract is grounded rather than invented. Measured across the 60 skills
installed on this machine: `name` and `description` appear in all 60,
`disable-model-invocation` in 16, `model`/`effort` in 54. The marker is a real
mechanism in use, not a design aspiration. The exception has a measured
precedent too: `se-help`, this surface's predecessor and still installed at
`~/.claude/skills/se-help`, carries no marker. It is named here as evidence for
the rule, not as a surface this suite asserts -- everything below is `sd-*`,
where `sd-help` is the one skill among eleven commands.

These run without an installer. That is the point: step 3e builds the renderer
that consumes this tree, so without these assertions the twelve surfaces would
sit unverified until then, and a missing marker would surface as a command that
silently invokes itself.

Since 5-iii the tree also holds the sixty-four folded skills, so the inventory
claim had to change shape. It used to be "the tree is exactly these twelve",
which is a list -- and a list of every surface is precisely what stops being
maintainable at seventy-six. What survives is the half that is actually load-
bearing: the *commands* are exactly these eleven, and every other surface in the
tree is a skill -- `sd-help` included, per the taxonomy's stated exception --
which is a property each file carries rather than a roster this file recites. A
sixty-fifth skill needs no edit here; a twelfth command still fails, which is
the invariant standing rule 2 asks for.
