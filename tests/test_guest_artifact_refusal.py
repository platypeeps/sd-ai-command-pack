"""sd:405 -- the guest-mode artifact refusal, performed rather than described.

`WORKFLOW.md` stated the refusal as a mechanical property: "every writing skill
refuses the upstream tree". Nothing refused anything. The rule existed once, as
a bullet in `skills/sd-plan/SKILL.md` addressed to an agent, and no code path
consulted `sd_lib.mode()` before a planning artifact was written -- which is how
two checkouts that resolve to `guest` came to carry 162 committed `prd.md` files
between them with nothing objecting on any of those occasions.

These tests are that refusal. The unit half asserts the sentence `sd_lib` hands
back through the injected `ask` seam, so no case here reaches the network. The
end-to-end half runs `bin/sd-review --scope planning` -- the one command
`sd-plan`'s sequence puts between writing the triad and promoting it -- as a
real process against a real repository holding a real `prd.md`, with a `gh` stub
on `PATH` answering for the remote, and asserts exit 2 and one sentence rather
than a traceback.
