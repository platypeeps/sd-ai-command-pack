"""Delivery evidence: the trailer block git reads, and who may record one.

Three guards, one mechanic. `git interpret-trailers --parse` reads a message's
*last* paragraph and nothing else, so a single blank line demotes a trailer to
prose and every reader downstream sees exactly what it would see if the author
had never written it. That is sd:5, which landed on main with its `Delivers:`
line one paragraph too high and had to be re-recorded by an empty commit.

Each guard is called directly rather than through the command that owns it,
and each has a control asserting the shape that must still pass. A test that
only asserts a refusal cannot tell a guard that fires correctly from one that
fires always, and `_delivery_reason` in particular refuses for six distinct
reasons -- a fixture that tripped an earlier one would "pass" while proving
nothing about the trailer check it was written for.
