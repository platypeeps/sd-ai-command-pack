"""`sd_lib.delivered`: the one question a checkout with no database asks git.

Nothing here mocks git. Every case builds real repositories on disk -- a bare
fixture remote, real clones, a real linked worktree, a real `--depth 1`, and an
unreachable remote made by pointing the remote URL at a path that does not
exist -- because the whole function is about what a *particular kind of
checkout* can and cannot see, and a mocked `git fetch` would have agreed with
every wrong answer about that.

The distinction the suite exists to defend, stated once here because it is not
visible in any single assertion:

    `no` is a positive finding from history the checkout actually has.
    `unknown` is the answer when the checkout cannot see far enough to say.

Both a shallow clone and an unreachable remote produce `unknown`, never `no`.
A checkout with no remote produces `no`, because it has all the history there
is. Getting that backwards does not fail loudly: a `no` where the answer is
`unknown` silently reopens a delivered item, and every reader that picks work
-- `sd-review --scope planning`, `sd-plan` -- picks it again and redoes it. So
three of the cases below assert `no` is *never* the answer, as well as
asserting what the answer is; an implementation that answered `no` on an
unreachable remote would pass a bare `assertEqual(..., "unknown")` suite the
day someone reordered two branches, and fail these.
