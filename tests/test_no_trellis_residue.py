"""A grep of the governed tree for the retired framework's name returns nothing
outside three named sets (sd:10, criterion 18): the exemptions of decision
note 1942 (`EXEMPT`), the lines another lane's pull request held when the
sweep ran (`HELD`, empty since the 31(b1) reword), and the lines a test must
quote to name the residue commands (`ALLOWED_IF_PRESENT`).

The three literals are the criterion's own: the framework's name with its
capital, its dot-directory, and its task script. The grep is case-sensitive
for the same reason: an identifier that carries the name in lower case is not
a claim that the framework is still here, and the criterion does not count it.

`EXEMPT` holds the lines decision note 1942 on sd:10 named, and nothing
else: the upstream pull-request guard in `AGENTS.md`, exempt while sd:241,
sd:242 and sd:244 are open, and the `.trellis` residue row of `sd-status` with
the test that exercises it, exempt until the gating fleet check passes and the
`RESIDUE` detectors are cut. Each entry is `(path, line text)`, the whole line
stripped of its indentation, so an edit above it does not move the exemption
off the line it names and an edit to the line itself -- a second literal
appended to an exempt one, say -- is not covered by it. A row that matches
no line, or more than one, fails `test_every_row_still_names_exactly_one_line`,
so neither set can outlive the lines it names or quietly widen.

`HELD` is a second, separate set: lines the sweep could not reach because
another lane's open pull request held the file. They are not the criterion's
exemptions and the comment on the set says which pull request held them.
The criterion is closed when `HELD` is empty, which it has been since the
sd:10 31(b1) lane reworded both lines; `HELD_BOUND` keeps the two rows as
the frozen ceiling, so `test_the_held_set_is_named_and_shrinking` fails a
row added back.

`ALLOWED_IF_PRESENT` is a third set, for lines another open pull request
adds: a test that names the residue commands must quote them, so #995's
`tests/test_archive_untouched.py` carries the `.trellis` removal string and a
comment naming the framework. Those rows are exemptions of the same kind as
the `sd-status` row, but they are matched by file and content only and may
match zero lines, so this test is green whether #995 merges before this
branch or after it. `test_every_allowed_row_names_at_most_one_line` keeps the
set from widening: a row that matches two lines fails.
