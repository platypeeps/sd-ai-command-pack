"""Fixtures for bin/sd-status: the whole report, and the gaps it must name.

Two levels, deliberately. The subprocess tests run the executable the way an
operator does, so an exit code under test is an exit code a caller sees. The
in-process tests reach for `workflow_checks` and `_protection_gaps` directly,
because "which enforcement legs are missing" is a pure function of two objects
and deserves to be tested as one rather than through six fake HTTP responses.

The fake `gh`, the fixture repository and the read-only digest come from
`tests.test_sd_pr_state`; there is one copy of them and this module imports it.

        test was wrong on its first writing.

        The two live items are the contrast that makes the rest able to fail.
        One of them carries the cut `parked:` line and must fire exactly like
