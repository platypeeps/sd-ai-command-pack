"""No module under `bin/` reaches `sd_db` except through `sd_lib.import_sd_db`.

sd:745 and sd:746. `sd_db` is provisioned into the pack's virtualenv and every
entrypoint starts `#!/usr/bin/env python3`, so no interpreter a person actually
invokes has the library on `sys.path`. `sd_lib.import_sd_db` makes the second
try, against the provisioned copy; an import that runs before it has been
called fails on every machine and then says "install the library" about a
library that is installed. `bin/sd-ship` shipped exactly that, and fourteen
other files were found carrying the same one-try shape by a grep. A list of
instances closes nothing; this closes the class.

The rule, per `sd_db` import (`import sd_db...`, `from sd_db... import`, or
`importlib.import_module` / `__import__` on a literal or f-string naming
`sd_db`), judged in the function it sits in:

  1. A call that reaches the helper comes first, on an earlier line of the
     same function. "Reaches" is computed, not listed: `import_sd_db` itself,
     or any function in `bin/` whose own body calls something that reaches it
     (`sd_handoff_rows.library`, `sd_work._library`, ...). A wrapper that
     stops calling the helper stops counting, with nothing to update here.
  2. Or the function is handed the library: it has a parameter named
     `sd_db`, which only a caller holding the imported module can pass.
  3. Or it is on `REACHED_WITH_THE_LIBRARY` below, which names the caller that
     already ran the helper. An entry whose function no longer imports
     `sd_db` fails the test, so the list cannot outlive its reasons.

The helper's own body is the one place a first try is allowed.

Parsed with `ast`, not grepped: the imports that matter are inside functions,
behind `try`, and spelled four ways, and a textual search for the helper's
name is satisfied by a comment. "Earlier line" is textual order, not control
flow -- a helper call in a branch that did not run still counts -- which is
the price of a check that does not execute anything.

Known limits, found by adversarial review on PR #907 and left open because
each needs data flow or execution this check does not do. The rule passes,
wrongly, on:

  - an import inside a `lambda`, which is not a scope the walk visits;
  - a helper call in a conditional branch, or inside a conditional wrapper
    (one that calls the helper on only some paths);
  - a helper call on the same line as the import, or after it on that line;
  - resolution by name only: `self.import_sd_db()`, `anything.import_sd_db()`
    or a local `def import_sd_db` all count as the helper, whatever the owner;
  - a module name that is not a literal (`import_module(name)`), including an
    f-string whose leading part is a variable;
  - a function whose `sd_db` parameter has a default, so a caller can omit it;
  - a generator whose helper call precedes the import but never runs because
    the generator is not consumed.
