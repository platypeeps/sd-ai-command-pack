"""One subprocess policy for `git`, enumerated from `bin/` rather than listed.

Criterion 31 of sd:10 asks for one git wrapper, asserted by a grep that finds
no second definition. Measured on 2026-09-19 the tree had nine, and the owner
decision of that date ruled on what "one" means here: not one name, but one
*subprocess policy*. A wrapper that differs only in argument order is a name;
a wrapper with its own timeout, or none, is a policy, and a second policy is
a bound nobody keeps in step.

So this does not count names. It walks `bin/` from the filesystem, finds every
place that hands `git` to `subprocess.run`, and holds each one to the rule
that applies to it. Enumerating is the point: a list written here would go
stale the first time somebody added a file, which is how the nine accumulated.

Three kinds of site exist, and the difference is not stylistic:

* **The policy.** `bin/sd_lib.py` runs `git` for everything that can import
  it, with the timeout, no shell, and failure-is-None. Anything importable
  reaches `git` through `git_output` and appears nowhere below.
* **The standalone hooks.** `bin/sd-handoff`, `bin/sd-handoff-restore` and
  `bin/sd-skill-use` are loaded by path with no `bin/` on `sys.path`, and two
  of them are pinned by their own suites to have no dependency there at all.
  They cannot borrow the policy, so they copy the one number it turns on and
  this file keeps the copies equal.
* **The deliberate variants.** Three call sites need something `git_output`
  destroys or refuses: raising instead of returning `None`, bytes instead of
  text, unstripped stdout. Each is named here with its reason. They still
  carry a timeout.
