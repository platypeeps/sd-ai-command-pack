"""sd:1406. An answer that cites no reviewed path is not advice.

Three answers were measured on the #1153 transcripts, each against a subject
of two paths. Two blind codex answers put a finding at no location and at
`/`; a sighted opencode answer cited `.github/workflows/tests.yml:484`. Before
the fix, the `/` answer was schema-valid, counted as a completed review, and
reached the operator as `advisory` at exit 0. The location-less answer failed
the schema, but its finding was still kept and dispositioned as advice once a
fallback reader answered clean.

The check reads structure, not prose. A completed answer none of whose
findings names a path the run reviewed is voided: it no longer counts toward
depth, and its findings are dropped. A completed answer with one located
finding is kept whole. A failed answer keeps its located findings and every
blocker; only its unlocated advice is dropped.
