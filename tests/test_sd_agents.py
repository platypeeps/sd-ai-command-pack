"""The `agents/` tree and how the installer renders it.

Agents are the taxonomy's third kind: a bounded worker with context isolation
and a declared tool set. The declaration is the whole governance mechanism --
an agent whose prose says "read-only" and whose frontmatter says nothing is an
agent the platform will hand every tool it has -- so the contract is asserted
here rather than trusted.

The fold that brought these five in is exactly where that could have been lost.
Their upstream templates carried no `tools:` at all for two of the five; the
governed versions existed only as files somebody had edited in place under
`~/.claude/agents`, which the next install from upstream would have overwritten.
These tests are what makes that a red check instead of a quiet regression.
