"""Draft runs: the headless lead drafts a spec for each captured item (pack sd:6361).

Design: system `docs/work/2026-10-25-lead-drafts-specs/design.md` (system sd:6013).

A task the dashboard captures in a managed repository with a remote, whose
lane runs on the hub (`build._repo_refusal`), queues one `assignment` of
scope `draft` in the capture's own transaction (`queue_if_eligible`). No
other path queues one: no `sd task add`, no backlog pass (ruling #31096).

The build-dispatch tick claims one draft at a time (`claim`): one
`runner_run` at step `claimed` on branch `draft/sd-<item>`, which names no
git branch, with no lease, so it counts against the machine cap only
(`build.room`). The item stays `planning`; its running assignment refuses
status writes until the run ends (`workflow.change_status`).

`build_run.DraftSupervisor` runs one read-only `claude -p` in the
repository's checkout, judges its last stream line, and hands the reply to
`parse`. `write` lands the spec and its questions in one compare-and-set on
the run, so they appear all at once or not at all, and a late supervisor
whose run was reaped writes nothing. Any other end goes through `end`:
a loss retries once as a fresh run, then blocks the assignment with a
`Draft blocked:` followup; an unparsed reply blocks it with no note.
