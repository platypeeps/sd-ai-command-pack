"""One review queue, made of rows the store already has (sd:3635).

The design is system's `docs/work/2026-10-12-review-queue/design.md`. A
repository or an experiment files a batch of small questions; the operator
answers each with one option; the producer exports the labels with their
provenance. No table is new:

- A **batch** is one task filed under the ref `review:<queue>:<batch>`, the
  key `sd task add --ref` files under, so the unique index on `(source,
  external_id)` makes a second filing find the first.
- Its first comment is the **header**: queue, batch, schema, source, mode,
  the seal in sealed mode, the question count and the digest of the batch
  file. A note is append-only, so the header is what binds; the item's title
  and body may change and bind nothing.
- A **question** is a `question` note in the Decisions format (one `Option:`
  line per choice), plus one `Subject:` line and up to five `Evidence:` lines.
  The batch's questions are the header's count of question notes after it;
  a question added by hand later is not one of them.
- The batch's optional **context** (purpose, rubric, what the labels feed)
  rides the header as `Purpose:`, `Rubric:` and `Feeds:` lines. A question's
  optional **recommendation** rides its note as two more evidence lines,
  `Evidence: Recommended: <option>` and `Evidence: Recommended because:
  <reason>`, so a reader older than system sd:5759 files it under evidence,
  which a blind batch already hides, and never reads it as question text.
  The header's `Recommendations: <n>` line marks a batch filed that way; only
  there are those lines read as one, so an older batch's evidence stays evidence.
  Whether the standing label agreed with it, and whether it was ruled before
  the recommendation could be seen (blind or sealed, and the question's first
  ruling), is read from the notes, never written.
- A **label** is the Decisions ruling, `Ruling on note #N: <option>`, written
  with the question's resolution in one transaction; **undo** is a
  `Withdrawn: ruling #M on note #N` decision with the question reopened; a
  **comment** is `On note #N: <text>`.
- An **approval** of an Approve-or-Reject question files its task under the
  ref `review-approved:<note>` in the ruling's transaction, as `apply` would,
  or finds the task that ref already names, and the ruling ends
  ` -> sd:<task>` (sd:4924). A withdrawal of it ends `; sd:<task> stays filed`.

Modes: `open` shows everything; `blind` asks the reader to show the text and
options only (the dashboard's job, not this module's); `sealed` is blind plus
a key the producer keeps outside the store, whose SHA-256 the header holds.
A sealed export refuses another key and an open question, and commits the
batch's close before it parses the key. A batch once closed refuses every
ruling and withdrawal through `rule` and `withdraw`. Every label, and whether
a question is open, is read from the note history up to the first close and
never from a question's `resolved_at`: a note written after the close by
another path (`sd task note`, a reopen) is read as `late` and moves nothing.
