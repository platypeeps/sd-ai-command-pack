"""The backup, and the restore that proves it.

A live WAL database is not a file a file-level mirror can copy consistently.
So the backup is its own step:
a snapshot into a dated directory, the two configuration files copied beside
it, and then **the copy is opened and checked**, because a backup nobody has
restored is a file, not a backup.

The order is the design:

1. Write a `checkpoint` row, with this run's id, **before** the snapshot.
2. Count the source and copy it into the dated directory, in one read
   transaction (`_snapshot`).
3. Copy configuration and the complete validated publication journal beside it.
4. Open the copy. Run `PRAGMA integrity_check`. Find the checkpoint row.
   Compare every table's count against the source.
5. Write the completed backup's ownership manifest. Prune only when requested:
   by count (`keep`) or by age (`keep_days`), never both.

Step 1 before step 2 is what makes step 4 mean something. A checkpoint
written afterwards would be in the source and not in the copy, and its
absence from the copy would prove nothing; written before, it is in both, and
a copy without it is a copy of something other than what was just checked.

**Step 1 is the one conditional step, and step 4 changes with it.** A
database waiting for `migrate` is exactly the one worth snapshotting first,
and the writable open is what refuses it, so `SchemaTooOld` reopens the file
`mode=ro` and no checkpoint row is written. Step 4 then proves the copy by
integrity and counts alone, and step 5 records `checkpoint: false`.
`_owned_backup` never skips the checkpoint question, so such a snapshot is
never owned, never counted for `--keep`, never pruned, and no row prune runs
after it. It restores like any older snapshot: `restore` migrates the staged
copy up to this library's version.

**Failures of the store never depend on the store.** Every function here
raises `BackupError` and writes nothing on the way out. The caller --
`sd-db-backup` -- sends one mail through the path the cron jobs use. That is
why the mail lives in the script and not in this module: a module that
reported its own failure by writing a row would have nothing to report a
failure to write a row.

    `owned_only` is the age prune's question (sd:5682): is this ours to
    delete, not does it restore. The manifest and the listing of names and
    kinds must match, and the database must hold its run's checkpoint row
    (`_checkpoint`, one row; a read-only snapshot is `Retained`). No file is
    hashed and the database is not verified, so a copy over SMB costs a
    listing and one read, not minutes.

    """Delete owned backups taken more than `days` days before `now`.

    Age comes from the directory's day, which `_dated_directory` takes from
    the run's own clock, so it is compared in that clock's zone. A day is
    removed only when the whole of it lies more than `days` days back:
    `D < (now - days).date()`. Every removed snapshot is therefore older than
    the window, and none younger is touched; one dated exactly `days` days
    ago is kept, until the next day. So a window of 7 holds between 7 and 8
    days of runs. Counting runs instead (`--keep 168`) would hold a week
    only while every hourly run happens; a Mac asleep overnight makes 168
    runs reach further back, and one that ran twice an hour makes it fall
    short.

    Only a directory whose day is past the window is checked -- the cheap
    name test first -- so an hourly run opens the few snapshots it may
    delete, not the whole week. The check is ownership, not restorability
    (sd:5682): the manifest and the listing must match (`owned_only`), but no
    file is hashed and the database is not verified. Hashing each copy on the
    share took minutes, so the job's bound removed 2 an hour while 24 aged
    out. Each is checked and removed before the next is opened, oldest
    first, so a run the bound stops keeps what it removed (fleet sd:5543).

    `moved` prunes copies away from where they were written, such as the
    hourly mirror on a share (sd:4011): the manifest's path proves nothing
    there, and its checkpoint time must also lie past the window, so a copy
    named for an older day than its data stays.

    A copy whose checkpoint body is the bare timestamp of a build before
    sd:3578 is dated and pruned like any other (sd:4694). A directory with no
    manifest always stays: a run that stopped before writing one leaves such a
    directory, but so can a hand-kept copy of the store, and nothing in it
    tells the two apart -- unless `unmanifested` asks otherwise, below. Every
    directory past the window that stays, `report` hears with its reason, and
    every one removed; one kept by design (`Retained`) is counted on one line
    per reason (sd:5065). `dry_run` returns what would go and removes nothing.

    `unmanifested` (sd:4917, an operator ruling) also removes a dated
    directory with no manifest whose day lies more than twice `days` back, by
    the same day rule: a copy stopped partway on a mirror is never finished
    once its source has rotated out. It is for a moved root only, and refuses
    one whose manifests do not all prove it holds copies (`_moved_root`). Such a directory
    goes only if a lookup shows it holds no manifest (`_holds_manifest`; a
    lookup that fails keeps it) and it is a real directory holding no link,
    mount or special entry (`_contained`), so nothing outside the root is
