"""Build runs read from the store into the monthly lane report (pack sd:6947).

`run_spans` turns each ended build run into its steps: a root for the run,
then its claim, build, each review round, enqueue, lane and merge, as far as
the run's row, its notes and its cost rows record them. Nothing leaves the
store: the genai-traces collector is the one trace sink, and sd-db sends no
traces of its own (pack sd:7365).

`month_report` reads those steps into a monthly Markdown draft for the
writing pipeline: item ids, PR numbers, counts, cost and run ids, never a
title, note body or detail.

The lane's prepare and gate steps live in the lane's own files, not here:
the `lane` step runs from the enqueue to the merge or the run's end.
