"""The Build queue and its claim, on the retired runner's tables (pack sd:6093).

Design: system `docs/work/2026-10-24-build-dispatcher/design.md`, step 1.

A Build press queues one `assignment` per item: role `author`, lane
`parallel`, scope `build`. A claim takes up to `BUNDLE_MAX` queued builds of
one repository as a bundle: one `runner_run` (the attempt) and one
`runner_lease` on branch `build/sd-<lead>`, every member `running` with its
`parent` the lead, and every item `in_progress`. While an assignment is
queued or running, `workflow.change_status` refuses the item's status writes
(criterion 7.19); a cancel is the way out.

Every write a supervisor makes is a compare-and-set on its own run, open and
unreleased (`write`, `enqueued`), so a late old supervisor writes nothing.
`reap` ends a run that fails `alive` in three steps, each safe to stop after:
the compare-and-set of its outcome, the kill of its builder's process group,
and one transaction that releases it and retries, blocks or cancels. A tick
that dies between them leaves an ended, unreleased run, and the next `reap`
starts at the kill.

Nothing here runs a process but the kill and the liveness probe; the
dispatcher (`build_run`, step 2) reads the load and the interactive builders,
which are not in the database, and passes them in.
