"""Teammate runs: an in-session builder a lead spawned, on the build run's rows (pack sd:7221).

Design: `docs/work/2026-11-02-builder-heartbeat/design.md`.

A lead's Claude Code teammate builds in its own worktree and writes no row,
so Today could not list it beside the headless build runs. `start` writes
what a build claim writes, with no lease and no process: one `assignment`
per item (scope `teammate`, lead first, each member's `parent` the lead,
`budget_minutes` the lead's budget) and one `runner_run` on the lead, with
the worktree and branch the lead named. `beat` refreshes the run's
`heartbeat_at`; the builder calls it at its own checkpoints (a commit, a
report). `end` closes the run once the lead has the builder's report.

The assignments hold `STATUS`, not `running`: a running assignment means
the runner owns the item, so every status write, cancel and merge guard
refuses it. A teammate's item stays the session's to move.

Only the lead's `end` releases a run. Neither silence nor every item done
proves the builder stopped: it beats only at checkpoints, and may still
write after its item lands. A run silent past its budget plus
`GRACE_MINUTES` reads `overdue` on Today and stays held. Each write is one
transaction, so a stop between two leaves either the old row or the new
one.
