"""The nightly priority sweep: every open work item gets a rank or closes (sd:6726).

The operator's ruling of 2026-10-29: a work item is filed with a priority
(`sd task add` refuses one without), and the sweep handles the rest, in
three steps, one run each night (`sd-db review priorities`):

1. **apply**: each ruled question of the `priority` review queue sets its
   item's priority, when the item still has none; a batch with no open
   question closes.
2. **close**: an item still unranked `CLOSE_DAYS` after it was filed is
   closed, with a note that names the sweep and how to reopen it; one a
   queued or running build holds is left open and reported as `held`.
3. **ask**: every other unranked item not already asked gets one question
   in tonight's batch, P1 to P4, with a proposed rank and its reason, for
   the Review page.

Work kinds only (`KINDS`): ideas are out of scope (grill addendum,
2026-10-29), and a review batch's own row is the queue, not work.
