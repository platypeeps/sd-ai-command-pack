"""A satellite's answer to a build-mismatch refusal: follow the hub's pins once, then run the command again (sd:4748).

The hub refuses a session whose `sd_db` build differs from its own
(`remote.BuildMismatch`). After every pack merge that changes the digest,
each satellite session was refused until `repo-sync.sh follow` ran, by hand
or by its 5-minute job: six episodes on 2026-10-15, about 13 minutes of
session time (sd:4188, the 18:12 MDT decision note).

No retry inside this process can pass (sd:3359): the handshake names the
build this process loaded, and `follow` changes the files on disk, not the
code in memory. So `attempt` runs the follow as a child, bounded, and on
success replaces this process with the same command, which loads the
followed build. Only an entrypoint that may run again from its start
installs it, through `hub.on_mismatch`; a server, a lane runner or a ship
keeps the refusal.

Guards:

* Recursion: `MARKER` is set in the follow's environment and in the re-run
  command's. A process that finds it set keeps the refusal, so a follow that
  calls `sd`, and a re-run still refused, never follow again.
* Mid-command: a process that already opened a hub session is part way
  through its verb; a re-run would do its first part twice (`sd gate run`
  would run the gate command again). It keeps the refusal.
* Stdin: a re-run reads the same descriptor 0. No `sd` verb reads stdin
  before its first hub session, or at all (bin/sd and the modules it
  dispatches to, read 2026-10-15), so a terminal, `/dev/null` or a file at
  offset 0 replays. A file past offset 0 was read; a pipe or socket cannot
  say whether it was. Both keep the refusal with the hint to run the
  command again after a follow by hand.
* Concurrency: two sessions following at once rely on follow's own refresh
  lock (`refresh_drain.py`). Its wait is capped at `DRAIN_WAIT`, so a lane
  run holding its runner lock on this satellite fails the follow instead of
  holding the session; a refused or waiting follow is a failed one.
* Time: the whole follow runs under `TIMEOUT`; past it its whole process
  group is killed, not just the shell `sh` ran, so the `refresh_drain.py`
  child that holds the refresh and lane locks and the `make setup` it may
  have started do not go on changing checkouts and config after `sd`
  reports failure. The refusal stands, and follow's own intent marker makes
  its next run finish the half-done move.
