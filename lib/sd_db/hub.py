"""The satellite's selector: `~/.config/sd/hub.json` (step 4).

Step 4 of `docs/work/2026-09-22-run-the-framework-from-a-second-machine/`.
A machine whose home holds this file is a satellite: `sd_db.connect` sends
every open of the default database to the hub the file names, and
`sd_db.default_path` answers with a `HubPath`, whose `exists()` asks the hub.

    {"hub": "hub.example.test", "port": 8769}

The selector is a file and not an environment variable. Cron and launchd
read no shell profile, and a satellite must refuse the same way from every
caller.

Three rules, each one a test in `tests/test_hub.py`:

* No file: `connect` opens the local database, as it always did.
* The file and no reachable hub: `HubUnreachable`, naming the hub. Nothing
  is created on this machine: no database, no folder for one.
* The file beside a local database: `HubConflict`. A machine is a hub or a
  satellite, not both, and the refusal is what keeps the satellite free of
  a second writer.

An explicit path other than the default is opened locally, as before: the
Jev meter's own file, a backup target and a test's fixture are not the
record, and the hub does not hold them.

`token_file` is for loopback only: `sd-db serve --loopback` refuses a
session without the token it wrote beside its database. A hub on the
tailnet carries no token; it admits the session by its peer's Tailscale
identity (step 7), so a satellite's `hub.json` names no `token_file`.

class _WriteFence:
    """SQLite's authorizer on this machine's own write connection (system sd:5986).

    Write unless fenced (#31093): only `elsewhere` refuses. `holder`, `off`
    and `unknown` write, so a Tailscale outage does not stop a healthy hub.
    Each boundary that makes a write persist asks: COMMIT, and the RELEASE
    of a savepoint opened outside a transaction. It trusts an answer up to
    `FENCE_SECONDS` old: the transaction's opening (BEGIN, or that
    savepoint) asks again before SQLite's write lock once the held answer
    passed half of that, and refuses nothing. A fresh ask at the commit held
    every other writer for a Tailscale call (pack sd:7042). A write outside a
    transaction commits when SQLite ends it, which no authorizer sees, so it
    is refused at prepare (`unwrapped`); the cursor runs it again inside
    BEGIN IMMEDIATE ... COMMIT (`_batched`), as it runs `executemany`. A
    transaction that wrote nothing commits without asking, so reads keep
    working; its opening may ask, once per half window.
    A pragma that changes the file is a write (pack sd:6328). Outside a
    transaction it runs again inside one, as other writes do:
    `incremental_vacuum` frees a page per row fetched, after execute().
    Those no ROLLBACK undoes (`_PRAGMA_UNDONE_BY_NOTHING`, VACUUM) ask
    afresh before they run, in a transaction or not; `incremental_vacuum`
    never runs, nor `page_size` or `auto_vacuum` (`_FORBIDDEN_PRAGMAS`).
    Only SQLite's own state ends a transaction here: the write flag and the
    outer savepoint clear when a statement is prepared outside one, never on
    a BEGIN, ROLLBACK or RELEASE that may yet fail (review of f716079a9).
    A write inside a transaction asks the held answer, to stop early; its
    commit decides. So a commit more than `FENCE_SECONDS` after the console
    rename, or after a sleep, rolls back.
    The connection caches no statement: Python does not authorize a cached one again.
    It holds its connection weakly, so the pair makes no cycle.
