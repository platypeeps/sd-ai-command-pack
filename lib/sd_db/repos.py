"""Which repositories the system knows about, and how they get into the table.

Criterion 6 enumerates `docs/work/*/prd.md` across "every repository the
`repo` table holds". Nothing in requirement 2 said how a row gets into that
table, and an unpopulated table makes the criterion pass over nothing: zero
repositories, zero files, zero rows with no file. A criterion that passes
vacuously is worse than one that fails, because it reports a green.

So the table is populated two ways, and only two:

* **By hand**, `sd-db repo add <path>`. One repository, deliberately, with
  its remote read from the checkout rather than typed.
* **From repo-sync's `repos.common.conf` and `repos.<profile>.conf`**,
  `sd-db repo seed`. That pair lives in `<config>/repo-sync/` (see
  `config.py`) and is what `repo-sync` clones on this machine's profile,
  one `<subdir> <owner/repo>` per line, and it is maintained because
  the sync breaks when it is wrong. Deriving from it beats a second list that
  only drifts. Reading the personal file alone missed every entry that lives
  in common.

Seeding registers only checkouts that exist on disk. A line naming a
repository this machine has not cloned is not an error -- the file is shared
across machines -- and registering it would put a row in the table for a
path nothing can enumerate, which criterion 6 counts as a row with no file.

**The table is the bound, not the disk.** Item D's runner clones a registered
repository's whole working tree into the worktrees directory, so a clone
carries its own `docs/work/*/prd.md` files. Those files are on the machine
and have no `item` row. They are never enumerated because enumeration reads
this table and a clone was never added to it -- there is no exclusion list to
keep in step. `add` refuses a path under the worktrees directory anyway, so
an operator cannot put one there by hand and discover the consequence at the
next sitting.
